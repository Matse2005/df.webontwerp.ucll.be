    <h1>Data and information</h1>
    <p>
      In the next chapter, we want to elaborate on the concepts of "data" and
      "information. What exactly do these concepts mean? Why are these concepts
      important for you as a (future) developer? From this chapter you should
      remember the following:

    </section>

    <h2>Difference between data and information</h2>
    <p>
      Before we get you started in this practically-oriented course, we want to
      take a moment to reflect on some <em>important concepts</em>. First, we
      want to talk briefly about data, and where the distinction is made with
      information. The two terms are often used interchangeably, but there is
      indeed a difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data</strong> refers to specific facts that can take the form of digits,
      numbers, words, characters, ... For example, '23', 'Turing', '1912', 'London',
      'Alan' and 'June' are each in themselves facts that can be considered data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Information</strong> refers to the meaning that users come to attach
      to these facts and the connections made between them. For example, the following
      information can be assigned to the facts above: "On June 23, 1912, Alan Turing
      was born in London. <em>
        We combine the data to assign context and value to it</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are used to filling out paper and digital forms. Most of these forms
      don't ask for our life story. Instead, we are asked to enter specific
      facts (data), for example, name, first name, date of birth, ... which were
      molded into a structure of a form. This form is often designed in function
      of a <strong>process</strong> in which the data is collected, tracked and processed.
      Once processed, the data can be retrieved and used as input for other processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, let's take the <emph>process of enrolling at UCLL</emph>.
      Upon your enrollment you will be asked to answer a number of questions.
      These questions have the purpose of gathering information about you as a
      prospective student and to know for which program you would like to
      enroll. For example, you will be asked to provide information about
      yourself (name, date of birth, ...), your previous education path
      (program, school, degree, ...) and for which program you would like to
      enroll (program, ...). The information you give is split up into atomic
      parts, the data. Each piece of data is entered into a field of the form.
      As soon as the form is submitted, the data is stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data are stored according to the structure of the registration form.
      The administration staff uses the data of the registrations to prepare for
      the academic year. The data allows them to put together class groups,
      create timetables, etc. In other words, the data that was previously
      collected at enrollment are now reassembled back into information to feed
      other processes. In translating collected data into useful information,
      the data is often restructured according to a different logic. For
      example, class composition does not take into account the date of birth,
      but does take into account the number of students within a program. In
      addition, the data can also be combined with other data. For example, the
      preparation of timetables is done on the basis of enrollments, but also
      the availability of lecturers and classrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here lies the role of you as future developers. It is your role to
      think about the need and importance of information for your applications,
      the translation of information into structured data and how to store this
      data efficiently. It is up to you to define the logic to create
      information from structured data and vice versa.
    </p>

    <h2>Data and IT applications</h2>.
    <p>
      As mentioned above, data are often collected in function of a
      <emph>process</emph>. IT applications are often developed for the purpose
      of digitizing or automating manual processes. The earlier example
      described registering a student online for a course at UCLL. Previously
      (in the days when your lecturers were enrolling for their studies) this
      was done entirely on paper, including the manual work to process the
      registrations which included a greater risk of errors. Meanwhile, this
      process has been digitized and automated as an IT application.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the IT applications must be able to collect, process, and store data.
      Also in the other direction, they must also be able to retrieve said data
      and display it to users. There is a need of being able to store data for a
      longer period of time. Storing data for a longer period of time is called <strong>persistent data storage</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When designing an application, the team of developers will begin to define
      an architecture of the application. This involves considering which
      components are necessary to build a functioning system. An application is
      thus considered not as a monolithic whole, but as a composition of
      different components, each of which has a particular function. These
      components are, for example, an interface for mobile devices (front-end),
      the ability to communicate with other applications, ... The different
      components each perform a certain function (this will be covered later in
      the program). In many cases, some form of persistent data storage will be
      part of the architecture. Through the various decades, a lot of technology
      for persistent data storage has been developed. In the context of this
      course, we focus on relational databases and DBMS since this is the
      standard solution for persistent data storage, but certainly not the only
      one.
    </p>

    <h2>Databases and DBMS</h2>
    <p>
      As a developer, as part of your applications, you will be collecting data,
      processing and displaying it to users. All the data you collect, is stored
      in a database. A <strong>database</strong> is viewed as a collection of "persistent
      data". In other words, a database includes a set of data that must be kept
      for a long period of time. For example, UCLL's student records system includes
      data relating to students, enrollments, courses, ...
    </p>

    <p>
      Persistent data is stored in the permanent memory of a system. The
      permanent memory or storage medium can take various forms, for example,
      hard disks, magnetic tapes, CD-ROM, ... The storage of data comes with a
      certain cost which strongly depends on the type of storage medium used.
      Hence, it is very important for a team of developers to consider the value
      of data being added to a database and to make a trade-off between which
      data is included in the database and which is not. That said, the cost of
      data storage has dropped significantly since the 2000s, so keeping some
      extra data won't be a problem in most cases.
    </p>

    <p>
      The technology we use to build these databases, to maintain, manage,
      secure and query (extract data from the database) we call a <strong>database management system (DBMS)
      </strong>. The DBMS is a software package that serves as an interface
      between the end users and applications on the one hand and the database on
      the other.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are a lot of database management systems and in the context of this
      course, we are using
      <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>. Other examples
      include.
      <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>,
      <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/">Oracle</a>,
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2022">Microsoft SQL Server</a>,
      <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/db2">IBM DB2</a>,
      <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database">MongoDB</a>,
      <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>, ...
    </p>

    <p>
      Database management systems come in a lot of different forms, some of
      which are designed for specific purposes. When choosing a database
      management system, a lot of different factors are considered, ranging from
      the cost of a license, the way the data is structured, data security,
      features, ... but this is beyond the scope of this course.
