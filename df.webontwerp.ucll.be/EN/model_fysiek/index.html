    <h1>Physical data model</h1>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we take the final step in planning our
      database, creating our physical data model. How do you convert a logical
      data model into a physical data model?
      </p><p>
        You must be able to explain the following terms, how we represent this
        (where relevant) and explain by example:
      </p>
      <section class="leerdoel">
        <ul>
          <li>Physical data model;</li>
          <li>datatype;</li>
          <li>null-value.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The final step in laying out our data model, is <em>the physical layer</em>. When we get to this step, we have already chosen a database model
        chosen and converted the conceptual data model into a structure that
        complies with this database model, resulting in the logical data model.
      </p>

      <p>
        The physical layer of our data model answers the question 'How should we describe the
        data structure according to our chosen DBMS?' In doing so, we supplement
        our data model with the following information:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>het <em>datatype</em> of a column</li>
        <li>de <em>length</em> of een value</li>
        <li>whether or not a value is empty (<em>null</em>)</li>
        <li>
          constraints (<em>constraints</em>) that we want to impose on a particular table
          (not discussed in this box)
        </li>
        <li>indexing (not discussed in this box)</li>
        <li>views (will not be discussed in this box)</li>
        <li>procedures (not discussed in this course)</li>
        <li>use of diskspace (will not be discussed in this course)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The reason we add this information in a separate layer is
        because it deals with the more <em>technical</em> aspects of the data model.
        For the same database model, there may be differences at the level of
        the DBMS. In other words, a physical data model for one DBMS may be
        differ from that of another DBMS system.
      </p><p>
        The differences are mostly limited, especially for DBMS for databases
        according to the relational database model, because <em>standards</em> were
        established. For the relational database model, standards were summarized
        in the ANSI standard for SQL, first in 1986 and more recently in 2016.
        Developers of DBMS for relational databases usually adhere
        to these standards, although they also add their own variants to differentiate themselves
        from other products on the market by offering their customers just a little more.
        The focus in this box is on PostgreSQL; we also do not make comparisons with
        other systems within this box.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, a database architect may also decide to structure the data slightly
        structuring (e.g., denormalizing) differently than the logical
        data model was specified. The architect will do this to optimize the performance
        or usability of the database, often taking into
        consideration of the technical capabilities of the chosen DBMS.
        These considerations are covered in a later section.
      </p>

      <h2>From logical to physical data model</h2>.
      <p>
        In translating a logical data model into a physical data model,
        in the context of this box, we are going to add the <em>following information added</em>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          we give the various names of tables and columns in line with
          our agreed naming conventions; to do so
          we must first define naming conventions;
        </li>
        <li>we define a data type and length for each of the columns;</li>
        <li>
          we indicate for each of the columns whether the value in the column can or
          cannot be empty (NULL);
        </li>
        <li>we impose restrictions (constraints) on a table.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Naming conventions</h2>
      <p>
        In the physical data model, naming conventions (<em>naming conventions</em>) play a major role.
        of tables and columns plays a big role. In particular, you want to strive for a
        naming conventions that are <em>readable</em>, <em>clear</em> and <em>consistent</em>. In doing so, many DBMS allow only a limited number of characters
        in the names of tables and columns. So you are often forced to keep it short
        to keep it short.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are different ways to set rules for naming, and
        each company will use its own rules. Some ideas:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          case of the names and/or separation of words:
                    <ul>
            <li>UPPER CASE,</li>
            <li>lower case,</li>
            <li>camelCase,</li>
            <li>PascalCase,</li>
            <li>snake_case,</li>
            <li>kebab-case: words are separated</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          use of plural or singular (table "players" or "player"?)        </li>
        <li>
          separate words from each other:
                    <ul>
                      <li>by an underscore (_),</li>
                      <li>by a period,</li>
                      <li>by a capital letter,</li>
                      <li>by a combination of the above.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          language (in an international environment it is best to always work in
          English)
        </li>
        <li>
          use of abbreviations to indicate, for example, tables, primary or foreign
          keys. You can also designate abbreviations to delineate certain
          domains within the data model.  
        </li>
        <li>
          rules for abbreviating long words by, for example, omitting all vowels
          omitting unless the word starts with a vowel.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>In addition, we can certainly already give <em>the following tips</em>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>don't use spaces;</li>
        <li>don't use foreign characters;</li>
        <li>don't use SQL or DBMS reserved key-words;</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Self, we apply the <em>following naming conventions</em>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>table:</strong> we use a singular name set in lowercase
          is put in lowercase. Different words are separated by an
          '_'.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>column:</strong> the column name is described in lowercase, with
          several words separated by an '_'. Try to keep the column name
          as short as possible, but at the same time in such a way that it is still possible
          to figure out what it means.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>primary key:</strong> if possible, we give the name of
          the key 'id'. This way, it is always easy for users to identify the primary
          key.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>foreign key:</strong>foreign keys are references to
          other tables, so we try to include the name of the original table
          into the name. For example, the primary key 'id' from the
          table 'lecturer' could be named 'lecturer_id' in other tables as a foreign key.
          might be named.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As mentioned, <em>you can define your own naming of tables</em>,
        and in your future work environment, some of this will already be done. The
        important thing is that you stay consistent!
      </p>

      <h2>Datatype</h2>

      <p>
        In the physical data model, we are going to define the <em>data type</em> for each column.
        Here we take into account the nature of the data we want to
        add. In the first steps you took with SQL, within the
        <a href="../SQL_intro/index.html#Single-simple-datatypes">chapter 'Intro SQL'</a>, you have already been introduced to the most commonly used data types:
        <code>char()</code>, <code>varchar()</code>, <code>integer</code> and <code>date</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to these data types, PostgreSQL offers a wide range of
        additional data types. Each data type has a particular role and, through
        the use of functions, not to mention additional capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        When defining the data type, you must therefore specify the
        <em>length</em>. Datatypes can have a <em>fixed</em> length
        (for example, <code>integer</code> 4 bytes, <code>boolean</code> 1 bit, <code>real</code> 4 bytes, ...) or a
        <em>variable</em> length (e.g., <code>char</code>, <code>varchar</code>, <code>numeric</code>, ...).
      </p><p>
        When specifying the length of a column, consider
        The maximum length a value could have. A datatype with
        a variable length allows you to still make a lot of
        space available, without taking up all of that space.
        occupied every time. A good guideline in to keep this realistic
        realistic.
      </p>

      <h2>NULL or NOT NULL</h2>

      <p>
        In physical design, we need to specify whether the value in a column <em>
          can be empty or not
        </em> can be empty. For the columns that should never be empty, we can specify 'NOT
        NULL'. For the tables where we have not specified this,
        the value can be empty.
      </p>

      <p>
        The value to be entered here based on the logical
        data model, is determined by two elements:
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          As the first element, we have the <em>foreign keys</em>. Depending
          of the relationship that exists between two tables through a
          primary and a foreign key, we must use the
          minimum cardinality to evaluate whether the value can be NULL. If the
          relationship is enforced, as for example when using an
          intermediate table, we must indicate that the foreign key is "NOT NULL.
        </li><li>
          As a second element, for each of the columns (beyond the
          primary and foreign keys) evaluate <em>
            whether from the client's logic it is permissible for a column to be
            is empty
          </em>. For example, an employee's name and first name are not
          used as a key, since they are not necessarily unique.
          However, an employee whose first and last name are left blank is
          possibly not very useful. Hence, we can additionally specify that
          these should not be empty.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The value NULL can mean two things: on the one hand, it can mean
        that there could be a value filled in, but that we do not
        know. The value could then be filled in at a later time.
        On the other hand, NULL could indicate that for this particular case there is no
        value possible, the column is not applicable. A comparison
        with a NULL value itself gives a NULL value, because a value
        comparing to something unknown is itself unknown.
