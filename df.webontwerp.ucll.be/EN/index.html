    <h1>Course Database Foundations</h1>
    <p>
      Dear student, welcome to the site belonging to the 'Database Foundations'
      course of the Applied Computer Science course at UCLL.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Toledo forms the basis and starting point of this course.</em> Communication,
      additional information specific to distance or day courses, assignments, etc.
      can be found in the Toledo course.
    </p>

    <p>
      This course text has as its first target audience students studying the
      Applied Computer Science course in <em>distance learning</em>. They have
      to make do without real classes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Day students will also use this course text. Of course, they do have about
      40 class hours on campus, which surely provides a different setting.
    </p>

    <p>This site contains two major sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Modelling: written by Steven Engels</li>
      <li>SQL: written by Jan Van Hee</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This introductory course is limited to the basics, the 'foundations'.
      After all, there after all, there should be plenty of learning left for
      the follow-up courses!
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="../leerpad/index.html">learning path</a> outlines the order in which you would
      best process the different sections.
    </p>

    <section class="info">
      <p>This info icon points to a text with some additional information.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="opgepast">
      <p>
        Please read this type of box very carefully because we know from
        experience that students often go wrong at this point. Sometimes we also
        guide you toward making an error for didactic reasons. So if something
        goes wrong unexpectedly, read a few lines further in the text. Often,
        the next paragraph with "However, you get an error message because ...".
      </p>
    </section>

    <p>
      The site has limited responsiveness and should provide a fairly good
      experience. But it goes without saying that a slightly larger screen is
      still more convenient than reading everything on a smartphone. The line
      length was limited so that the text is easy to read.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some students asked for a paper copy. You can print the pages printed, but
      then of course lose all the dynamic (links, solutions, ...). If you want
      to print everything anyway, maybe show the solutions all displayed first,
      so that they are printed along with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most important verb in this text is 'do'. The only way to master this
      is to go through the roadmaps, do the exercises, working with code and
      drawing models. Certain exercises are picked up again at a later time, so
      when you do the exercises, make sure to save your results.
    </p>

      A lot of hard work went into this site. The authors thank colleagues Bram
      and Rudi for thorough proofreading and many suggestions. Still, <span class="doorstreept">there is an opportunity</span> it is certain that there is room for improvement. Find typos, odd sentence
      structures, missing or unclear pieces, please let us know to jan [dot] vanhee
      [at] ucll [dot] be. We welcome all constructive feedback so that we can continue
      improving this course site. If you like it, you can of course also let us know
