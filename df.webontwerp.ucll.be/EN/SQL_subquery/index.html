    <h2>Schema studenten_campus</h2>
    <section class="info">
      <p>
        Take a quick look at the figure's ERD. You can find the schema
        'student_campus' in the database 'df' via the pooling connection (or the
        5... connection). Do a <code>SELECT *</code> of both tables to get an
        idea of the information contained in the schema.
      </p>

      Specifically, it involves a listing of all eight campuses of UCLL and a
      table of 1,000 students with some personal information for each student,
      which campus they go to (a student can only belong to one
      campus) and how far they live from this campus. The latter field is
      not mandatory. By the way, we created this schema as an example for
      automatic data generation in DBSchema or using a site
      such as <a href="https://mockaroo.com/">https://mockaroo.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Who lives farther from a campus than the average distance?</h2>
    <p>
      There are several types of SQL queries. One kind asks only the answer
      to a question. That can be a number, one or more names, a
      date, ... For this type of query, you do not need to provide the query(s) used
      give. Only the answer is sufficient. An example of such a
      question is the following exercise. Make that one and check your answer.
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        How many students live farther from their campus than the average distance?
        Only the answer was asked, not the queries you used. Find
        you the correct answer: 401 students?
      </p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <p>
          This is typically a question you can quickly solve with two
          simple queries. The first query looks for the average of all
          distances:
          <pre><code>SELECT AVG(afstand_tot_campus)
FROM student;</code></pre>

          The result of this query is 52.01658. Note that null values
          do not count to calculate an average, such as<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/functions-aggregate.html">the documentation briefly mentions the function 'avg'</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can now use this number in a subsequent query:
          <pre><code>SELECT count(*). -- of eventueel gewoon * en dan aantal rijen aflezen in de query tool
FROM student
WHERE afstand_tot_campus &gt; 52.01658;</code></pre>
        </p>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <p>
      So for this type of SQL query, just answer "401. Fine, point
      earned!
    </p>

    <p>
      However, for another type of exam question, you need to give the query. In addition
      you may only give one query, which your lecturer must be able to copy and
      execute in pgAdmin. A solution with two separate queries, where you
      then have to copy the answer of the first to the second query is not
      allowed.
    </p>

    <p>
      The above exercise has an elegant solution: use a <em>subquery</em>
      (also called a nested query). The following query provides the solution (401)
      of the exercise in one query:
      <pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM student
WHERE afstand_tot_campus &gt; (
  SELECT AVG(afstand_tot_campus)
  FROM student
);</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <code>WHERE</code> clause, a new <code>SELECT</code> is started.
      We call this query the inner query. The query around it
      called the outer query. You can define different levels
      nesting. A subquery can return one or more rows to the calling
      query. The above is an example of a <em>scalar</em> subquery:
      as the subquery returns only <em>one number</em>. You can nest a subquery
      nest in the <code>SELECT</code>, <code>FROM</code>, <code>WHERE</code> or
      <code>HAVING</code> clause.
    </p>

    <h2>Average distance of Proximus students</h2>
    <h3>Two versions of the same exercise</h3>
    <p>Now solve the following exercise with a subquery:</p>
    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        Give the average distance to campus of all students attending
        campus Proximus. Use one query with a subquery. The answer
        is: 49.0319
      </p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT avg(afstand_tot_campus)
FROM student
WHERE campus_id = (
  SELECT id
  FROM campus
  WHERE naam = &#39;Campus Proximus&#39;
);</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <p>
      Perhaps when reading the above statement you thought 'I can do that
      just as well with a <code>JOIN</code>?' Rightly so! Now solve the same exercise
      without a subquery by just using a <code>JOIN</code>:
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        Give the average distance to campus of all students going to
        campus Proximus using a <code>JOIN</code>.
      </p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT avg(afstand_tot_campus)
FROM student S INNER JOIN campus C on S.campus_id = C.id
WHERE C.naam = &#39;Campus Proximus&#39;</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h3>Choosing between JOIN and subquery</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes you have no choice and have to use a subquery, as in the
      first exercise. You can't solve those with a <code>JOIN</code>.
      Conversely, for some queries you need a <code>JOIN</code>. However
      however, you have the choice between a subquery and a <code>JOIN</code>. It is
      difficult to unambiguously define which is the best choice. For complex
      queries, a <code>JOIN</code> is often <em>more</em> efficient. A subquery
      is usually easier to read, though.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, you should be able to use both types of query. It is
      possible that for a given query on the command you will have to explicitly use one of
      both will have to use.
    </p>

    <h2>Subquery with IN operator</h2>
    
    <p>
      We looked at the <code>IN</code> operator already <a href="../SQL_where/index-2.html#IN">in the section on the <code>WHERE</code> clause</a>. After the <code>IN</code> can come the result of a subquery. Create
      the following exercise now.
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          Show the five oldest students attending a campus in Heverlee.
          Work with a subquery.
        </p>
        <figure class="center">
          <img src="../../assets/subquery/oudste5Heverlee.png" width="350" alt="">
        </figure>
      </div>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT voornaam || &#39; &#39; || familienaam AS naam, geboortedatum
FROM student
WHERE campus_id IN (
  SELECT id
  FROM campus
  WHERE locatie = &#39;Heverlee&#39;
)
ORDER BY geboortedatum
LIMIT 5</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        This example can also be solved perfectly with a <code>JOIN</code>.
        Recreate the exercise with a <code>JOIN</code>.
      </p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT voornaam || &#39; &#39; || familienaam AS naam, geboortedatum
FROM student S INNER JOIN campus C ON S.campus_id = C.id
WHERE locatie = &#39;Heverlee&#39;
ORDER BY geboortedatum
LIMIT 5</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h2>Subquery with the ALL operator</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>ALL</code> operator compares a value to <em>any</em> value
      of the result table. We illustrate this with the following example.
    </p>
    <p>
      List all students who are younger than all students whose
      whose first name begins with "Al. Again, you could solve this with two queries
      solve. First, query the birth dates of all students with the
      first name requested:<pre><code>SELECT geboortedatum
FROM student
WHERE (voornaam like &#39;Al%&#39;)
ORDER BY geboortedatum DESC</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      It turns out that the youngest of these students was born on Feb. 27.
      2004. You can now query in a second query all students with a
      birth date greater than (because they must be younger!) this date:<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE geboortedatum &gt; &#39;2004-02-27&#39;
ORDER BY geboortedatum DESC</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>You will eventually find a list of 22 students.</p>
        <p>
          You can combine these two consecutive queries into one query by
          using a subquery. You will find the same 22 students:<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE geboortedatum &gt; ALL (
  SELECT geboortedatum
  FROM student
  WHERE voornaam LIKE &#39;Al%&#39;
)
ORDER BY geboortedatum DESC</code></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The following exercise does not look so difficult at first glance,
      but there is an unexpected problem that you might have to
      struggle with. Tips and solution can be found in the usual place, but
      try it yourself first!
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          List all students who live closer to their campus than
          all students who attend a campus in Diest and whose
          last name contains the letter 'a' twice (capital letters are also allowed). Your
          may use only one query (which may, of course, contain subqueries
          ). Rank according to increasing campus_id and decreasing distance.
        </p>
        <figure class="center">
          <img src="../../assets/subquery/afstandDiest.png" alt="">
        </figure>
      </div>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <p>
          It is a good idea to first solve such an exercise in pieces
          solve. Sub-question 1: What is the campus_id of the campus(es) in Diest?
          <pre><code>SELECT id
FROM campus
WHERE locatie = &#39;Diest&#39;</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          There appears to be only one campus in Diest, namely the campus with id = 2.
          With this we can now answer part question 2: give all students from
          this campus who have a family name with two times (upper or lower case
          does not matter) have an 'a'.
          <pre><code>SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE lower(familienaam) LIKE &#39;%a%a%&#39; AND campus_id = 2
ORDER BY afstand_tot_campus ASC</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Verify that the result effectively includes only students who attend
          campus 2 and have a surname with at least 2 times the letter 'a'
          have. The smallest distance turns out to be 15 km. Finally, we can
          answer the last part of the question: all students from the
          student table who live less than 15 km from their campus:
          <pre><code>SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE afstand_tot_campus &lt; 15
ORDER BY campus_id ASC, afstand_tot_campus DESC</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          This turns out to be a list of 106 students. Puzzling everything together
          into one big query, with two subqueries in it is now not so
          difficult:
          <pre><code>SELECT *
from student
WHERE afstand_tot_campus &lt; ALL (
  SELECT afstand_tot_campus
  FROM student
  WHERE lower(familienaam) LIKE &#39;%a%a%&#39; AND campus_id IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM campus
    WHERE locatie = &#39;Diest&#39;
  )
)
ORDER BY campus_id ASC, afstand_tot_campus DESC</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Yet this query does not appear to give the correct result. The
            result does not contain any rows at all! What is going on?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem is in sub-question 2. After all, the list of all students from
          campus 4 with twice an 'a' in the surname contains a
          number of null values in the distance. Any comparison of a number with
          a null always gives a null, as this query demonstrates:
          <pre><code>SELECT null &gt; 999 -- resultaat is niet true of false maar null
SELECT null &lt;= 999 -- resultaat is niet true of false maar null</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, each test <code>WHERE distance_to_campus &lt; ALL ...</code> will always fail, leaving no row in the result.
          Fortunately, the solution is not that difficult: <em>
            In subquestion 2, avoid null values in the result
          </em>. So we add a single condition in the first subquery:
          <pre><code>SELECT *
from student
WHERE afstand_tot_campus &lt; ALL (
  SELECT afstand_tot_campus
  FROM student
  WHERE lower(familienaam) LIKE &#39;%a%a%&#39;
    AND afstand_tot_campus IS NOT null --Vermijd null in het deelresultaat
    AND campus_id IN (
      SELECT id
      FROM campus
      WHERE locatie = &#39;Diest&#39;
    )
)
ORDER BY campus_id ASC, afstand_tot_campus DESC</code></pre>
        </p>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h2>Subquery with the ANY operator</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>ANY</code> operator compares a value to any value in a table
      and is satisfied <em>if the comparison applies to at least one value in the table</em>. The table being compared to must contain at least one value.
      The example below explains the principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want a list of all students from campus 7 who are older than
      at least one student from campus 4. The following code returns a list of 135
      students who meet the condition:<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE campus_id = 7 AND geboortedatum &lt; ANY(
  SELECT geboortedatum
  FROM student
  WHERE campus_id = 4
);</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      As always, it's a good idea to parse a query properly to
      understand how everything works. Let's query the list of all
      students from campus 7:<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE campus_id = 7</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      That list contains 136 students, so one more than the first query! We
      quickly examine where the difference is.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are looking for the youngest student from campus 4 first:<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE campus_id = 4
ORDER BY 4 DESC</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      That turns out to be Lisa Vargas, born Sept. 30, 2004. In campus 7
      however, there is one student even younger than Lisa Vargas, namely Kate
      Gonzales, born on Oct. 12, 2004. Thus, she does not meet the
      condition with the <code>ANY</code> and consequently does not appear in the result.
