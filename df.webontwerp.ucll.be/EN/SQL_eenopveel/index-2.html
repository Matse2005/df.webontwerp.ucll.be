      In the next chapter, we introduce SQL queries that use multiple tables
      using <code>JOINS</code>. You will then, of course, need a schema that
      consists of <em>multiple tables</em>. This chapter introduces you to
      a one-to-many relationship between two tables. In one of the<a href="../model_logisch/index.html">
      following lessons on modeling
    </a> this is fully detailed. Here you will find only a brief introduction.
      </p>

      <h2>Two tables</h2>.
      
      <p>
        In the previous chapters, the various components of a <code>SELECT</code> statement were worked out. As a basis, we used a table that was the translation
      was the translation of this conceptual model:
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/select/opo_conceptueel.svg" alt="Conceptueel model van een OPO">
    </figure>
    <h3>Separate tables</h3>
    <p>
      This schema has one <em>entity type</em> ('Training Component') with a
      number of <em>attributes</em>. One of those attributes is the lecturer code of the
      coordinator of the OPO. After all, each OPO has a unique coordinator. The
      obvious to add a second entity type 'Lecturer' to
      the schema. After all, we have a lot of information about lecturers. This
      entity type contains information about all lecturers, not just the
      coordinators of an OPO. A naive attempt is following figure:
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/een-op-veel-SQL/2_losse_entiteittypes.svg" alt="Twee onafhankelijke entiteittypes: een slecht idee!">
    </figure>
    <p>
      If you translate this to PostgreSQL you get two separate tables. However, this
      structure, however, is a <em>source of problems</em>. We mention two
      possible errors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Someone adds a row (= a new course unit) to the table
        'Course unit' with a coordinator that is not in the table 'Lecturer'
        is.
      </li>
      <li>
        Someone deletes a row in the "Lecturer" table. The lecturer from this row
        however, is also coordinator of an OPO.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both operations will cause the database to contain errors. Your
      can then no longer look up info from some OPOs about the coordinator of
      the OPO. This is not permissible. <em>You want your RDBMS ("Relational DataBase Management System") to protect you
        protect against operations that introduce errors into the schema</em>.
    </p>

    <h3>Linked tables</h3>.
    <p>
      The problem, of course, is that the two tables cannot simply exist separately
      may exist. <em>There is a relationship between the two</em>. The conceptual
      model from the following figure makes this relationship visible:
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/een-op-veel-SQL/gekoppelde_entiteittypes.svg" alt="tussen beide entiteittypes bestaat een relatie">
    </figure>
    <p>
      From right to left you read the relationship as 'is coordinator of', from
      left to right it could then become something in the style of 'has
      as coordinator'. Each OPO has at least one and at most one (i.e. right
      one) coordinator. Not every lecturer is coordinator of an OPO, but a
      lecturer could possibly be coordinator of several OPOs. The
      cardinality on Lector's side is thus (0, N). Thus, this is an
      example of a one-to-many relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the attribute 'Coordinator' from an earlier figure is
      omitted. Indeed, it has been replaced by a relationship with a new
      entity type 'Lecturer' because we feel the need to do more than just
      keep track of a lector's number.
    </p>

    <h3>Translation to relational model</h3>
    <p>
      Now how do you translate this one-to-many relationship into a <em>relational</em> model?
      After all, PostgreSQL is an example of a relational database. If we take the
      <em>conceptual</em> model from the previous section to a <em>logical</em>model, that logical model will have to be a relational model.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can hear all about logical models in detail in the <a href="../model_logical/index.html">'Logical data model'</a>. The sole purpose of this section is to briefly introduce you to this
      so that we can move on to the next particle in our exploration of the SQL language (viz.
      <code>JOIN</code>) can be worked out. The logic model looks like this
      :
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/een-op-veel-SQL/logisch.svg" alt="Logisch model voor deze relatie">
    </figure>
    <p>
      For now, it's enough that you can read this diagram, and it's not even that
      difficult:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each entity type becomes a table, represented by a rectangle with a
        title: Educational Entity and Lecturer.
      </li>
      <li>Each attribute of an entity type becomes a column in the table.</li>
      <li>
        Each table has a primary key (PK), represented here <span style="background-color:yellow">in yellow</span>. That primary key has a unique value for each row in the
        table.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each course unit is required to have one coordinator. There is therefore a
        relationship between the two tables. In the table 'Course unit' a
        'Coordinator' column has been added. This column is a so-called 'Foreign
        Key' (FK, 'foreign key', <span style="background-color: #0f0">indicated in green</span>) because each value of this column must occur as a PK of the
        Lector table.
      </li>
      <li>
        The connection between the two tables makes it clear that the contents of the
        column corresponds to the value of the 'Lector_id' column. The symbol
        (two dashes) in the <span style="color:#33f">small blue circle
        </span> indicates that each course unit is required to have one lecturer as coordinator
        has.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conversely, the symbol in the <span style="color:#ff8000">larger orange circle</span>that each lecturer can be coordinator of zero (bullet) or one or more
        OPOs (crow's foot).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This logical model is finally converted to a <em>physical</em> model,
      where we specify further information that depends on the specific properties
      of the chosen RDBMS (in our case PostgreSQL). For example, an example would be
      The data types of the columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The physical model was drawn with DBSchema. We will come to <a href="../SQL_DBschema/index.html">later</a>
      in detail. This physical model corresponds to the logical model, in a
      slightly different notation (notice the <span style="color:rgb(120,160,190)">blue departing arrow</span> indicating that this field is an FK referring to the <span style="color:rgb(164,143,72)">
        yellow-brown arriving arrow
      </span> at lector_id). Also, each field has been given a data type (<code>char</code>, <code>date</code>, ...):
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/een-op-veel-SQL/lector-opo.png" alt="fysiek model met twee tabellen en één-op-veel relatie">
    </figure>
    <p>Add this one-to-many relationship in the database is done as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First create the table 'lecturer'.</li>
      <li>
        Search for the primary key ('primary key') of the lector table. This
        primary key is the 'lector_id' field. The data type of this primary
        key is a <code>char(8)</code>, because a lector code always begins
        with a 'u' followed by seven digits. Note that we are actually using the
        designations 'field' and 'column' interchangeably.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the table 'training part' a column should now be created
        with exactly the same data type as the data type of the primary key in
        the lector table, so also a <code>char(8)</code>. We call this 'transferring the
        primary key transfer' and refer to it in the OPO table as an
        'external key' (or 'foreign key').
      </li>
      <li>
        Now link these two columns using a constraint (<code>constraint</code>).
      </li>
      <li>Now <em>first</em> enter the data in table 'lector'.</li>
      <li>
        <em>After that</em> you can fill table 'course section' with rows.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Realization in your own schedule</h2>
    <p>
      From here, you need to roll up your own sleeves and <em>create the two tables effectively</em>. After all, we want you to soon be able to add and remove information in your own tables
      add and remove information, and that won't be possible if we let everyone work in the same table
      table. So start pgAdmin and execute the following steps.
      execute.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you follow the roadmap below (based on the steps in previous section)
      you get two linked tables filled with data. On these
      some small exercises. In the next chapter on <code>JOIN</code> we will use this schema as a basis.
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The following steps assume that everyone has their own schedule
            with the name 'rxxxxxxx', using of course your own
            r number. The easiest way is for you to use the pooling connection
            used at 62324.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check your schedule to see if there may already be a table
            'course unit' or 'lecturer' is present. If so,
            then remove this table with a <code>DROP TABLE ...</code> in a query
            tool. Remember: either use for each table name first the name of
            the schema, followed by a period and then the table name, or you put your
            <code>search_path</code> properly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Download the file <a href="../../assets/one-to-many-SQL/lector-opo-SQL.html">'lector-opo-SQL.txt'</a>. The next steps use pieces of this SQL code to build everything
            build and populate with data. Each time, you can copy the piece
            from this text document and then paste it into your query tool and
            execute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create the table 'lector' by executing the <code>CREATE</code> code
            for this table from the file you just downloaded. Nothing new
            to see here: two fields not required, some different data types,
            a primary key, ...
          </li>
          <li>
            Now create the table 'training item' by copying
            copy/paste from the txt file. About this code we need to give a
            little bit of explanation:
            <pre><code>CREATE TABLE rxxxxxxx.opleidingsonderdeel (
  opocode char(6) NOT NULL ,

  ...

  coordinator char(8) NOT NULL ,
  CONSTRAINT pk_opleidingsonderdeel_opocode PRIMARY KEY ( opocode ),
  CONSTRAINT fk_opleidingsonderdeel_lector FOREIGN KEY ( coordinator )
    REFERENCES rxxxxxxx.lector( lector_id )
);</code></pre>
            <p>
              This last <code>CONSTRAINT</code> is new. Loosely translated, this
              constraint says the following: "the 'coordinator' column of this table refers
              to the <em>primary</em> key 'lector_id' of the table 'lector'
              and is thus a <em>foreign</em> key". It is a good idea to use each
              <code>CONSTRAINT</code> a <em>sense name</em>. In this
              case: 'fk' (for 'foreign key') followed by the two names of the two
              tables involved. The tool DBSchema that we will use later for this,
              does this naming automatically.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Think logically about <em>the correct order of filling in the data in the two
              tables</em>. The OPO table depends on the lector table. You can only
            coordinator for an OPO if it already exists in the lector table.
            exists. So first fill the lector table by a copy/paste
            operation of the <code>INSERT</code> statements from the txt file.
            <pre><code>INSERT INTO rxxxxxxx.lector( lector_id, naam, voornaam, email, straat, nummer,
  gemeente, geboortedatum, van, tot, geslacht ) VALUES ( &#39;u0042352&#39;, &#39;Adriaens&#39;,
  &#39;Gerben&#39;, &#39;gerben.adriaens@ucll.be&#39;, &#39;Ankerstraat&#39;, &#39;12&#39;, &#39;1330 Rixensart&#39;,
  &#39;1984-02-16&#39;, &#39;2017-09-01&#39;, null, &#39;M&#39;);
INSERT INTO rxxxxxxx.lector( lector_id, naam, voornaam, email, straat, nummer,
  gemeente, geboortedatum, van, tot, geslacht ) VALUES ( &#39;u0057764&#39;, &#39;Bogers&#39;,
  &#39;Goedele&#39;, &#39;goedele.bogers@ucll.be&#39;, &#39;Elzasgang&#39;, null, &#39;2830 Willebroek&#39;,
  &#39;1979-09-09&#39;, &#39;2006-11-20&#39;, null, &#39;V&#39;);
INSERT INTO ...</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, now that the lector table is populated, you can also populate the OPO table with
            data. This time we'll do it with a CSV list. Copy these
            lines from the list and put them in a new .csv file. Import
            this .csv file like (<a href="../SQL_CSV/index-2.html">see section 'CSV file'</a>):<pre><code class="language-plaintext">opocode,studiepunten,naam,van,tot,taal,semester,coordinator

    <h2>Response of the RDBMS to errors</h2>.
    <p>
      Now make the following small exercises. Sometimes it is <em>explicitly intended to make an error</em>so that you learn to properly interpret error messages from our RDBMS.
    </p>

    <section class="taak">

        Add a new lecturer. This is Anouk De Ridder with u-number
        u0012047. She lives at Kerkstraat 23 in 3053 Haasrode, was born on 5
        May 1994 and joins us today. Mail addresses to UCLL are

          You get an error message that a lecturer with this lecturer code already exists

        Finally, add a new OPO: 'Trees and graphs' with code 'MBI39A'.
        This OPO was given in the second semester, stopped this year and ran
        from September 15, 2017 to September 14, 2022. The OPO was given in
        Dutch and had 3 credits. Coordinator of the OPO was the
        lecturer with u number 'u0099998'. Write the <code>INSERT</code>, execute
        and interpret the result.

          With this code, you do the <code>INSERT</code>:
                    <pre><code>INSERT INTO rxxxxxxx.opleidingsonderdeel( opocode, studiepunten, naam, van,
  tot, taal, semester, coordinator ) VALUES ( &#39;MBI39A&#39;, 3, &#39;Bomen en grafen&#39;,
  &#39;2017-09-15&#39;, &#39;2022-09-14&#39;, &#39;nl&#39;, 2, &#39;u0099998&#39;);</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          The database server refuses to execute this <code>INSERT</code> and
          returns the following error message:
          <pre><code>ERROR: insert or update on table &quot;opleidingsonderdeel&quot; violates
  foreign key constraint &quot;fk_opleidingsonderdeel_lector&quot;
DETAIL: Key (coordinator)=(u0099998) is not present in table &quot;lector&quot;.
SQL state: 23503</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since no lecturer with this lecturer code is yet present in the
          lecturer table, you cannot add a new OPO with as coordinator this
          lector. Only after you have added this lecturer in the lecturer table,
          can you add the OPO.
