    <h2>Grouping rows</h2>
    <p>
      In <a href="../../NL/SQL_CSV/index-2.html#Gegevens-groeperen-met-GROUP-BY">the chapter on importing a CSV file</a> you came into contact with grouping rows for the first time. Often
        a question involving the word "per". "Enter <em>per lecturer</em>
        the number of OPOs for which this lecturer is coordinator". "Please provide <em></em> the
        total number of credits from all OPOs now or previously given in that language.
        have been given". Granted, that last sentence does not contain the word "per," but you can
        rephrase it as "Provide <em>per language</em> the total number of credits
        of all OPOs that are or have been given in that language."
    </p>
    <p>
      The image we use is: <em>group the rows by the same value of a given field (or fields)
        in a box</em>. From that box, you can then no longer view individual rows. You must
      limit yourself <em>to summary information</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, let's consider the question above: "For each lector, please provide the
      number of OPOs for which this lecturer is or was coordinator".
    </p>
    <section class="info">
      <p>
        You can still run the queries on the table 'training part'
        in the schema 'uclloket' of the database 'df' or in your own version
        of this.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          In a first step, as an exercise, write the query that generates the following
          figure, namely a list of all coordinators with opo code,
          name of the opo and semester, ordered by rising lecturer code
          (u-number):
        </p>
        <figure class="center">
          <img src="../../assets/groupby/sortbycoord.png" width="600" alt="">
        </figure>
        <p>Not such a difficult query, right?</p>
            </div>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT coordinator, opocode, naam, semester
FROM opleidingsonderdeel
ORDER BY coordinator</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>
    <p>
      You can read in this figure that lector 'u0012047' is (or was) coordinator of
      'Problem Solving Thinking', 'Web Development 1' and 'Front-end
      Development. Now if you group by lector then all rows with
      the same value for the 'coordinator' column together in one box. The
      first box thus contains three rows. On the box is the name of the
      field that is common to all these rows, so 'u0012047'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second box labeled "u0015529" contains two rows. The third
      box ('u0032987') contains only one row, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because these rows are together in a box, you can no longer retrieve individual
      data in the <code>SELECT</code> clause anymore. If you try to do that
      you get a typical error message, as the following piece of code shows:
      <pre><code>SELECT coordinator, opocode, naam, semester
FROM opleidingsonderdeel
GROUP BY coordinator

-- het resultaat van deze query is deze foutmelding:
ERROR: column &quot;opleidingsonderdeel.opocode&quot; must appear in the GROUP BY clause
  or be used in an aggregate function
LINE 2: select coordinator, opocode, naam, semester
                            ^
SQL state: 42803
Character: 50</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      This query just shows a summary of all the 'labels' of the boxes
      and is executed without any problems:<pre><code>SELECT coordinator
FROM opleidingsonderdeel
GROUP BY coordinator</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may only look inside the box and provide certain summary information
      given in the <code>SELECT</code>, such as the number of rows, the sum of all the
      rows as far as a particular column is concerned. <em>We call these summary functions 'aggregation functions' and talk
        about data 'aggregation'</em>. In the next section, we look at several of these functions.
    </p>

    <h2>Aggregation functions</h2>
    <h3>Number of rows count</h3>
    <p>
      The question we are still trying to answer is "Give <em>per lecturer</em>the number of OPOs for which this lecturer is or was coordinator". In this sentence
      you already know by now that the "per lector" bit means that you have to
      should group together rows that have the same value for coordinator. <em>
        Counting the number of rows contained in one box
      </em> you do with the function <code>COUNT()</code> (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html">documentation</a>). If you want to count full rows, use <code>COUNT(*)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The final query that returns the answer to the question is:<pre><code>SELECT coordinator, COUNT(*)
FROM opleidingsonderdeel
GROUP BY coordinator
ORDER BY coordinator</code></pre>
    </p>

    <h3>Sum of certain data in a group</h3>
    <p>
      A second aggregation function is <code>SUM()</code>. <em>You use it to sum values in a given column</em>. Caution: we regularly see students
      <code>COUNT()</code> en <code>SUM()</code> switch! Now make the following exercise.
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          Write a SQL query that generates the summary of the total
          number of credits for which a lecturer is coordinator. Organize the
          result according to decreasing total number of credits. You should
          obtain the figure below. As always: do you also pay attention to the correct
          heading of each column?
        </p>
        <figure class="center">
          <img src="../../assets/groupby/sumSP.png" width="350" alt="">
        </figure>
      </div>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT coordinator, SUM(studiepunten) AS &quot;totaal aantal SP&quot;
FROM opleidingsonderdeel
GROUP BY coordinator
ORDER BY 2 DESC</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h3>Minimum, maximum and average</h3>
    <p>
      The last three aggregation functions are <code>MIN()</code>, <code>MAX()</code>and <code>AVG()</code>, respectively, for the minimum, maximum or
      arithmetic mean of <em>values in a given column</em>. Make
      following exercises.
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          Create a list that shows the average number of credits for each semester
          shows. Order the answer rows by semester from small to large. Your
          should obtain the figure below. Can you also include the name of the OPO
          mention?
        </p>
        <figure class="center">

        <p>
          Not every task will contain the word "per. Language has many
          alternatives for asking the same thing anyway. So here you will have to
          group by semester and you will have to use the aggregation function <code>AVG()</code>. Obviously, you cannot retrieve information from individual OPOs
          queries (such as the name) because that is "information that is in the box.
          The following query is a possible solution:
        </p>
        <pre><code>SELECT semester, AVG(studiepunten) AS &quot;gemiddeld aantal SP&quot;
FROM opleidingsonderdeel
GROUP BY semester
ORDER BY 1</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        Slightly more difficult ... List by language the number of OPOs of
        at least 4 SP taught in that language. You don't have to
        organize.

        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT taal, COUNT(*) AS aantal
FROM opleidingsonderdeel
WHERE studiepunten &gt;= 4
GROUP BY taal</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h2>Grouping on an expression</h2>.
        <p>
          Usually you group on a particular column, but it is also possible to
          group on a "calculated column" (expression). Each OPO has a
          start date. From this start date you can easily extract the year with <a href="../../NL/SQL_select/index-2.html#Extract-…-from">
        <code>EXTRACT</code>
      </a>. As an example, we provide the query that answers the following question
      answers, "List for each year how many OPOs newly entered
      entered the program in that year".
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT EXTRACT(year FROM van), COUNT(*) AS &quot;aantal OPOs&quot;
FROM opleidingsonderdeel
GROUP BY EXTRACT(year FROM van)
ORDER BY 1</code></pre>

    <h2>Grouping on multiple columns</h2>
    <p>
      The following query groups on two columns: semester and credits:<pre><code>SELECT semester, studiepunten, COUNT(*)
FROM opleidingsonderdeel
GROUP BY semester, studiepunten
ORDER BY 1, 2</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      This query creates 15 "boxes" (see figure). The first box shows on the
      label "semester 1, OPOs with 3 SP." There are four rows in this box. The
      second box is "semester 1, OPOs with 4 SP." Thus, there is only one OPO. etc.</p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/groupby/grouptweekol.png" width="400" alt="Groeperen kan ook op meerdere kolommen">
    </figure>

    <h2>HAVING</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>HAVING</code> clause has already been covered <a href="../../NL/SQL_CSV/index-2.html#HAVING">in the chapter on CSV files</a>. Students often find it difficult to distinguish from the
      <code>WHERE</code> clause and that is understandable because they are doing something similar.
      The
      <code>WHERE</code> immediately after the execution of the FROM component selects
      <em>which rows may be retained</em>. This is then
      calculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>HAVING</code> component, however, is executed only after creating
      the 'boxes' when grouping. <em>This condition decides which boxes may remain and which will disappear from the
        result</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Exercises</h2>
    <p>Now make the following exercises.</p>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          For odd semesters, list the number of credits
          and number of OPOs in that semester. Sort according to decreasing number of
          credits. Obtain the following figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tip for finding the odd semester: to do this, look at the
          possibilities of <em>the remainder in integer division</em> (the so-called 'modulo'
          operation), do a search for 'Modulo' on the page <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-math.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-math.html</a>.
