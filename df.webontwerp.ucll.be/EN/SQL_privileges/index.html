    <h1>Allocation of PRIVILEGES</h1>
    <p>
      Consider your ISP in KULoket for a moment. Behind KULoket is an extensive
      database. At the beginning of each semester you can make adjustments in your ISP
      e.g.. Add or omit OPOs, adjust sequences in another phase than
      your basic phase etc. <em>
        Obviously, you cannot view another student's ISP,
        because that is personal information
      </em>. But have you ever wondered who within UCLL does have access
      to your ISP? Who can change it?

    </p>
    <p>
      Your student pathway coach (STC), which goes without saying because you can discuss the ISP
      discuss with your STC, who, by the way, must also approve it. People from the
      student secretariat, for example, sometimes have to adjust the basic sequence, so they
      also get access. Ordinary lecturers (without an STC role), however, cannot view
      view students' ISPs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we'll give you a simplified look at the
      rights system of PostgreSQL.
    </p>
    <h2>Privileges - rights</h2>
    <p>
      As an STC, I have <em>limited</em> access to all ISPs in KULoket. If I
      go to my son David's ISP (studied at KULeuven), I get this
      message:
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/privileges/DavidISP.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>
      Thus, I <em>do</em> have the right to <em>survey</em> the ISP.
        consultbut
      <em>not</em> to make <em>changes</em> to it.
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        Can you think of a reason why an STC at UCLL can still consult ISPs of
        KULeuven students can access?
      </p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <p>
          One reason is that a student pathway coach at UCLL should be able to advise new students
          should be able to advise new students who were already doing something at KULeuven. In order to
          assess whether such a student could get exemptions, it is
          it makes sense for STC to be able to request an overview of every
          student at the KULeuven association. An STC should only be able to see
          what credits a student obtained, not with what grades this
          occurred. So I don't get to see those credits!
        </p>
      </div>
      
</section>
    <p>
      We talk about "privileges" within Postgresql. Granting privileges to
      other users in SQL with <code>GRANT ... PRIVILEGE ... TO</code>. We will first give some examples and then discuss the <code>GRANT</code> statements that can be useful for a database job where you need to
      collaborate with other people within the same database schema.
    </p>

    <h2>GRANT</h2>
    <p>Without going into detail, first some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA examoef TO student</code>: all users
        who have the role 'student' get access to the schedule 'examoef'.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>GRANT SELECT ON TABLE customer TO local_r0987654</code>: user
        'local_r0987654' is allowed to <code>SELECT</code> statements on the table
        'customer' in the current schema.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA project TO local_01234567,
          local_02345678, local_03456789</code>: give these three students <em>all</em> permissions to <em>all</em> tables
        of which you are the owner.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You define access rights with the <code>GRANT</code> statement. This is
      one of the more complex statements in SQL. We will limit ourselves to those things
      that are useful for any group work. From <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-grant.html">the extensive documentation of <code>GRANT</code></a>we extract some possibilities. Don't panic if the following overwhelms you a bit.
      We elaborate in the following sections.
    </p>
    <p>The formal definition looks like this:</p>
    <p>
      <pre><code>GRANT { { SELECT | INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE | REFERENCES | TRIGGER }
  [, ...] | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }
  ON { [ TABLE ] table_name [, ...]
    | ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name [, ...] }
  TO role_specification [, ...] [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]
  [ GRANTED BY role_specification ]

GRANT { { CREATE | USAGE } [, ...] | ALL [ PRIVILEGES ] }
  ON SCHEMA schema_name [, ...]
  TO role_specification [, ...] [ WITH GRANT OPTION ]
  [ GRANTED BY role_specification ]</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>No panic!</em> First, process the rest of this chapter and then come back for a moment
      back to the definition above. It will then look a whole lot more readable
      look.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical exercise related to rights</h2>
        <section class="info">
      <p>
        In what follows we will get hands-on in postgreSQL. We will use
        pgAdmin. You will make these exercises preferably in pairs. It is also possible
        alone (e.g. for distance learning students). Each student has
        after all, two separate users: your r-number on the regular connection
        52324 and your local_r-number on the pooling connection 62324. The exercises
        are set up as a kind of role-play between two users (<a href="https://militaryalphabet.net/">'Alpha' and 'Bravo'</a>).
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      Screenshots and code below were created for user
      'local_u0012047' ('Alpha', interpreted here by lector Jan) and user
      'local_0145920' ('Bravo', lecturer Steven). If you create the exercise yourself,
      of course you replace our two usernames with your own r-number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perform the steps in the following worktext. If something goes wrong, please
      please read on. We intentionally let you make mistakes here and there in order to
      learn from them ...
    </p>

    <h2>Owner</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
        Anyone who creates an object (schema, table, etc.) in a database is automatically
        owner of this object.
      </em> Now perform the following steps in the database belonging to your sequence ('1TX31',
      ...):
    </p>

    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Alpha creates a new schema named 'u0012047_privileges' in
            the pooling connection 62324.
          </li>
          <li>Bravo also uses the pooling connection.</li>
          <li>
            Only the owner currently has privileges to do anything in this
            schema. To demonstrate this, Bravo tries to create a table in this
            schema.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Bravo creates (via a <code>CREATE</code> statement) a very simple
          table 'customer' with only two columns: customer number (integer, this
          is the primary key so mandatory) and name (<code>varchar(50)</code>, also mandatory).
          <em>Don't forget to put the name of the schema before the name of the table
            otherwise you will create a new table in public!</em> Normally, Bravo gets an error message in the style of: <pre><code>ERROR: permission denied for schema u0012047_privilegesLINE 1: create table u0012047_privileges.client („Äê) state: 42501
Character: 14</code></pre>
        </p>
      </div>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        
      
</section>

    <h2>Giving rights to your schedule</h2>
        <p>
          Bravo cannot create new objects (such as a table) in the schema of
          Alpha. <em>
            It is now up to the schema owner to assign appropriate permissions
            granted to another user.
          </em> Now put next steps into practice:
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Alpha gives certain rights to the schedule to Bravo. This can be very
              limited to only use (<code>USAGE</code>), as we do
              e.g., set for the schema on an exam. After all, we do
              not want students to make their own changes to the schema (new
              tables etc). Alpha, however, wants his peer to be able to
              schema and types the following command into a query tool:<pre><code>GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA u0012047_privileges TO local_0145920--The word PRIVILEGES is not required, so shorter is:GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA u0012047_privileges TO local_0145920</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              If all goes well, the server responds with:<pre><code>GRANTQuery returned successfully in 60 msec.</code></pre>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Bravo has now been granted all rights to Alpha's schedule.
              Although ... all rights? Bravo tries to drop the schema:<pre><code>DROP SCHEMA u0012047_privileges</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the database server responds with an error message:<pre><code>ERROR: must be owner of schema u0012047_privilegesSQL state: 42501</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, <code>ALL PRIVILEGES</code> actually means "everything
              except <code>DROP</code>. You can never drop someone
              someone else's schema, unless you are <em>superuser</em> of the database server
              are.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Bravo now tries again in Alpha's schema to create the new table
            "customer. It should succeed now. Try this out!
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        
      
</section>

    <h2>Giving rights to a table</h2>
    <p>
      Bravo was able to successfully create the small table 'customer'. We are now
      next things on this table.
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Bravo adds a customer with number 789 and name 'Dieter Desmedt'
              to the table. This should work without a problem, see figure:
            </p>
            <figure class="center">
              <img src="../../assets/privileges/KlantDieter.png" width="400" alt="">
            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Alpha tries to add a row to the table 'customer' ('Wim
              Claes' with customer number 5). However, it gets the following error message:<pre><code>ERROR: permission denied for table client state: 42501</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              That error message makes sense, because Alpha is not the owner of the
              'customer' table object. <em>The fact that Alpha does own the schema is irrelevant.
                matter, because this is only about the permissions on the table itself.</em>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Bravo now returns <code>INSERT</code> right to Alpha: <pre><code>GRANT INSERT ON TABLE u0012047_privileges.client to local_u0012047;</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>
              You can visualize those permissions nicely in pgAdmin. Right click on the
              table 'client' and choose properties... The figure below tells me
              that local_0145920 is the owner of this table:
            </p>
            <figure class="center">
              <img src="../../assets/privileges/tabelproperties.png" alt="">
            </figure>
            <p>The security tab provides additional information:</p>
            <figure class="center">
              <img src="../../assets/privileges/tabelsecurity.png" alt="">
            </figure>
            <p>
              Just translate a few words: 'grantor' is the one who gives the
              rights, 'grantee' is the recipient of the rights. This
              screenshot shows that user local_u0145920 <code>INSERT</code> has given rights
              given to user local_u0012047. <em>By the way, you can change permissions yourself in this tab and save this
                save. However, at least for the exam, you should also
                using SQL statements in pgAdmin.</em>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now Alpha can add a row to the table:<pre><code>INSERT INTO u0012047_privileges.klant VALUES(5,&#39;Wim Claes&#39;)</code></pre>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Alpha notices, however, that this is not the right client, so it must be
              removed:<pre><code>DELETE FROM u0012047_privileges.klant
WHERE klantnummer = 5</code></pre>
            </p>
            <p>Explain what happens when this query is executed.</p>          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Bravo also gives Alpha <code>DELETE</code> rights. Alpha then tries to
              delete the client with number 5 again with the query above
              above. The surprising result is that this fails because Alpha does not have
              does not have enough permissions! How can that be? The owner of the table (Bravo)
              just gave <code>DELETE</code> permissions, didn't he?
            </p>
            <p>
              The answer to these questions is <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html">in the postgres documentation</a>. We quote briefly, "In practice, any nontrivial <code>DELETE</code> command will require <code>SELECT</code> privilege as well, since
              it must reference table columns to determine which rows to delete.".
              Since the <code>DELETE</code> query above is the row with customer number
              5 must be able to <em>select</em>, Alpha must therefore also <code>SELECT</code> permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bravo, also give your student the <code>SELECT</code> permissions on your table,
              so that Alpha can eventually remove the wrong row anyway? Fine!
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        
      
</section>

    <h2>Overview rights</h2>
    <p>
      You can find the full list of privileges at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html">the page already mentioned</a>. For us the most interesting ones are (the system is much more extensive
      than this small overview):
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>ALL</code>:all rights (except <code>DROP</code>).</li>
      <li>
        <code>SELECT</code>: select column(s) in a table. Almost
        also always needed for <code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> privileges.
      </li>
      <li><code>UPDATE</code>: right to update columns in a table.</li>
      <li><code>DELETE</code>: delete rows in a table.</li>
      <li>
        <code>CREATE</code>: right to create a new schema in a database,
        or create a new table in an existing schema.
      </li>
      <li><code>USAGE</code>: right to access in a schedule.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For a group work, in practice you will give to the group members all the
      permissions. One person creates the schema and gives everyone rights:<pre><code>GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA ... TO local_r1, local_r2, local_r3</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each student who creates a new table in this scheme then gives the
      others all rights to those tables. You can also suddenly give privileges
      on all tables in a schema:<pre><code>GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA ... TO ...</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Op het examenschema van de gewone dagopleiding passen we volgende
      privileges toe:<pre><code>GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA examenschema TO student;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA examenschema TO student;</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      In other words, on the exam, you get access to all the tables of the schema and
      can only perform <code>SELECT</code> queries.
    </p>

    <h2>REVOKE</h2>
    <p>
      Everything you can <em>grant</em> in terms of privileges you can also <em>remove</em>with <code>REVOKE</code>. You simply replace in the above examples
      the word <code>GRANT</code> with <code>REVOKE</code>.
