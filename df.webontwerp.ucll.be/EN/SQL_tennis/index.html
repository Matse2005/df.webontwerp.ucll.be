    <h1>Exercises SQL on database for a tennis club</h1>
    <p>
      We move to a larger schema, with 5 linked tables. This
      schema is the basis of the book "The SQL Textbook," 7th edition, Rick van der
      Lans, Academic Service. This textbook was until recently used as a basic manual
      used in the TI course.
    </p>
    <h2>The tennis database</h2>
    <h3>Relational physical model</h3>
    <p>
      The figure below shows the ERD for this schedule. Study this diagram
      thoroughly and read carefully the explanations in the following sections. On this scheme
      many exercises follow.
    </p>

    <h3>Important information about the association/database</h3>
    <p>
      The tennis club was founded in 1970 and from the beginning a
      number of administrative records have been stored in a database. This database
      consists of the following tables: players, teams, matches, fines and
      board members.
    </p>

    <p>
      The player table contains data on <em>spelers</em> who are members of the tennis club,
      such as names, addresses and dates of birth. Joining the association takes place
      always takes place on January 1 of a given year. Thus, players cannot become members in the middle
      become members in a year. The player table does not contain historical data. If
      a player cancels his or her membership, he or she disappears from the table.
      Also, in case of any moves, the old address is overwritten with the new
      address, so the old address is not stored anywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tennis club has two types of members: recreational players and
      match players. The first group only plays matches among themselves,
      so no matches against players of other clubs. The results
      of the mutual matches are not registered. Match players
      Play in teams against players of other clubs. The results
      of these<em>wedstrijden</em> are tracked, however. Each player has a
      unique number, regardless of whether they are match players or not. This player number
      is handed out by the association. It is mandatory that every competitive player
      is registered with the tennis association.
    </p>

    <p>
      The league, which is a national institution, gives each competitive player a
      unique union number. This union number usually consists of numbers, but may
      also contain letters. If a competitive player no longer
      matches, but becomes a recreational player, the association number expires. Note,
      recreational players do not have a union number, but do have a player number.
    </p>

    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/tennis/tennisclub.jpg" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>
      The tennis club has a number of <em>teams</em> competing in leagues.
      For each team, the captain and the division in which the team currently
      competes in are recorded. The captain does not need to have
      have played for the team. It could be that a particular player may at one time be
      captain of two or more teams. Also in this table, no history is
      kept. When a team is promoted or relegated to another division
      the registered division is simply overwritten. The same applies
      for the captain of a team: when changing, the number of the old captain is overwritten.
      captain is overwritten.
    </p>

    <p>
      A team consists of a number of players. If a team plays against a team from
      another association, each player on that team plays a
      match against a player of the other team (we assume for convenience
      assume that matches in which pairs play against each other do not
      occur). The team whose most players win their match is the
      winner.
    </p><p>
      A team does not always consist of the same group of players. In case of illness or
      vacations, substitutes are sometimes needed. A player can therefore
      teams. When we talk about "the players of a team", then
      means the players who have played at least one game for the team.
      team. Again, only players with a union number may
      play official matches.
    </p><p>
      A tennis match is made up of a number of sets. The person who has won the most
      sets won is the winner. For each match it is determined in advance
      with how many sets won the match is won. In general
      the match is stopped when one of the two players has won two or three sets
      has won. Possible end positions of a tennis match are thus 2-1
      or 2-0 if played until one of the players has won two sets
      won two sets (best of three), or 3-2, 3-1 or 3-0 if played to three
      sets won (best of five). A player can win his or her match
      or lose, a draw is not possible. In the match table
      for each match separately records which player has played the match
      played the match and for which team. It also records how many sets the
      the player has won and lost. From this can be deduced whether he or she
      won the match.
    </p><p>
      For unregulated behavior of players (late attendance, aggressive behavior
      or failure to appear), the league will impose <em>boetes</em> imposed. Fines will be
      paid by the association. Once paid, they are recorded in the fines table.
      As long as a player plays matches, all fines are kept on file for
      him or her imposed and paid.
    </p><p>
      When a player leaves the association, all his or her data in
      the five tables are destroyed. If the association withdraws a team, all
      all data on that team is deleted from the teams and matches table.
      If a match player stops playing matches and he or she
      thus becomes a recreational player again, all match and penalty data are deleted from the
      respective tables.
    </p><p>
      Since Jan. 1, 1990, the board membership table has kept track of who is on
      the
      <em>bestuur</em> sit. Four positions are distinguished: president, treasurer,
      secretary and general member. A new board is elected every year on January 1.
      When a player holds a board position, the start and end dates
      of these are recorded. If someone is still active, no end date is entered.
    </p>

    <h3>CREATE statements</h3>
    <p>
      You don't have to build this scheme yourself. <em>It can be accessed through the pooling connection, "exercises" database,
        schema ‘tennis’ or also via connection 54321 in the table 'basis_rdbms'.</em> This schema is already in the <code>search_path</code>. Therefore, the following
        code without mentioning the schema first:
      <pre><code>SELECT *
FROM spelers -- dus niet nodig om tennis.spelers te schrijven</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Below we provide the SQL code to create the five tables, but you don't
      so you don't have to, because this schema is just ready to go. <em>We do expect you to understand all the lines in this code.</em> The<code>CHECK</code> restrictions (<code>CONSTRAINTS</code>) are new,
      but presumably these are not that difficult to decipher. It is really
      important to study the diagram carefully.

    <h3>Some points of interest</h3>
    <p>
      In the ERD (and the <code>CREATE</code> code we just want to point out a few
      points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Note that <em>spelersnummer</em> has a central role in the diagram.
        It is in one table the primary key and in the four other tables the
        external key (‘foreign key’).
      </li>
      <li>
        The board member table has a <em>samengestelde</em> primary key.
        In the figure you can see that by the two key icons, in the code there are
        two columns in the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        A common mistake is not taking into account the fact <em>That the player number in the team table is the number of the captain
          of a team</em>. To know who has played matches effectively, you need to go into the<em>wedstrijdentabel</em> use the player number.
      </li>
    </ul>
