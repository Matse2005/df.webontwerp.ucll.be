    <h1>The SELECT clause in detail</h1>
    <p></p>
    <section class="leerdoel">
      <ul></ul>
    </section>

    <p>
      This chapter and the next four are actually one big topic. We look at the
      various components of a query in more detail. The first two chapters SQL
      already introduced you to<code>SELECT</code>, <code>FROM</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, <code>GROUP BY</code>, <code>HAVING</code> en <code>ORDER BY</code>.
      Now it's time to dive a little deeper into these clauses.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this chapter, we will look at some of the features of <code>SELECT</code>. As an example, we will use an extended version of the table 'course
      section' which is used in the <a href="../SQL_intro/index.html">introduction SQL</a> was already being used. Need we say more? <em>
        This is a working text. Reading is nice, doing is even nicer. Test
        things and make exercises.
      </em>
    </p>

    <p>
      We use in this chapter a simple scheme with only one table. This schema
      corresponds to the following conceptual model:
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/select/opo_conceptueel.svg" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>
      The entity type 'training unit' has eight attributes. The attribute 'opo
      code' is the key attribute.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can find the table 'course unit' in the schedule 'uclloket' in the
      database 'df'. In order to get this table to you, the following steps (we
      will come back to them later). These steps are only for illustration. You
      cannot perform them yourself because you have no write permissions in the
      database 'df'.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        I open a query tool in the database 'df' and run this code: <pre><code>CREATE SCHEMA uclwindow</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        All colleagues and students should have access to this schedule:<pre><code>GRANT USAGE on schema uclwindow to student;
GRANT USAGE on schema uclwindow to lector;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, I create the table 'training item':<pre><code>CREATE TABLE uclwindow.courseunit (
  opocode char(6) NOT NULL ,
  studypoints smallint NOT NULL ,
  name varchar(100) NOT NULL ,
  fromdate date NOT NULL ,
  todate date ,
  languagecourseunit char(2) NOT NULL ,
  semester smallint NOT NULL ,
  coordinator char(8) NOT NULL ,
  CONSTRAINT pk_courseunit_opocode PRIMARY KEY ( opocode )
);</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Everyone should be given SELECT rights. It is not intended that students
        to modify this table, delete or update rows, etc. So the permissions are
        limited to SELECT only:<pre><code>grant select on all tables in schema uclwindow to student;
grant select on all tables in schema uclwindow to lector;</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, 21 rows were added via an import of a .CSV file. This could
        have been done with <code>INSERT INTO</code> as well, of course.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Requesting something</h2>
    <p>
      With <code>SELECT</code>you can request something from a database server.
      That can even be a small calculation:<pre><code>SELECT 3*4; -- give 12
SELECT sqrt(200); -- returns the root of 200, i.e., 14,142....
SELECT TRUE AND FALSE; -- result is FALSE</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      A little silly to use a database server as a calculator, but so it can be
      done.
    </p>

    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        You can use mathematical functions in SQL (think of the ones on your
        calculator such as sin, cos, ...). Above is one example: <code>SELECT sqrt(200)</code> returns the square root of 200. 200. Find the SQL function you use to round
        up a number. A good source for this is<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-math.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-math.html</a>.
      </p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT ceil(2.1) -- gives: 3
SELECT ceiling(2.1) -- alternative, does exactly the same thing
SELECT ceil(-2.1) -- gives: -2 (careful with negative numbers: -2 &gt; -2.1)</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h2>Selecting columns</h2>
    <p>
      What interests us more is extracting information from data stored in a
      database. We already did that in the introductory examples, so we can be
      brief here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the <code>*</code> you can <em>all</em> columns of a table query:<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      The database server begins to view the <code>FROM</code> clause. The entire
      table 'courseunit' is loaded into the server's working memory. Then the server
      looks at the <code>SELECT</code> clause. The star <code>*</code> indicates
      that all columns should be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose we want to see only the columns with the name and the semester in
      which it was given, this can be done as follows:<pre><code>SELECT name, semester
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    </p>

    <h2>Alias for a column name</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes you want <em>other headers</em> for a displayed column. Suppose that
      we run the following query to get a summary of the start date when each OPO
      was first given:<pre><code>SELECT name, fromdate
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the second column will be the name "from. Perhaps you would prefer
      the word 'start date' as the column title? That can be done very easily
      with an <em>alias</em>. You give it using the word <code>AS</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT name, fromdate AS startdate
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    <div class="opgepast">
      <p>
        Beware if you use several <em>words with a space in between</em>. Then
        you must enclose these aliases between <em>double quotes</em> to put as follows:<pre><code>SELECT name, fromdate AS &quot;startdate OPO&quot;
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
      </p>
    </div>

    <section class="opgepast">
      <p>
        A point of interest and source of neglect in SQL is the use of single
        and double quotes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single quotes ('...') are used in SQL for strings or dates.</li>
        <li>
          Double quotes ("...") are reserved for names (called identifiers) of
          tables, schemas and aliases with special characters (such as a space,
          hyphen, etc.). There are tools (such as DBSchema, <a href="../SQL_DBschema/index.html">see later</a>) that, in the code they generate, they always enclose table and
          schema names in double quotes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Creating new columns</h2>
    <p>
      You don't have to limit yourself to the columns that appear in the
      database. It is not that difficult to add new columns, whether or not
      based on existing columns.
    </p>
    <h3>Constant text or number</h3>
    <p>
      If you put a string or number as a column, this is repeated for each row
      in the result.
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        Describe the result of the following query:<pre><code>SELECT opocode, name, &#39;Applied Computer Science&#39;
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
      </p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        You get an overview of all rows of the table with opo code and name and
        a new column 'Applied computing' repeated for each row is repeated.
      </div>
      
</section>

    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        Adjust the code from the previous exercise so that above the column with
        the repeated text 'Applied Computer Science' as the column header, the
        word 'Education.' Then modify the query so that the column header shows
        'Training Proximus' shows.
      </p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT opocode, name, &#39;Applied Computer Science&#39; AS &quot;Education&quot;
FROM courseunit
 
-- versie 2
SELECT opocode, name, &#39;Applied Computer Science&#39; AS &quot;Training Proximus&quot;
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h3>Math</h3>
    <p>
      One credit corresponds roughly to 25 hours of work, all included
      (attending classes, studying, completing assignments, studying for exams,
      taking the exam, ...). The following query creates a new column of "work
      hours" based of the given column study points:
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT opocode, name, studypoints * 25 AS workhours
FROM courseunit</code></pre>

    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        Leave out 'AS workinghours' yourself in the above query to see what the
        (ugly) default column header becomes.
      </p>

</section>

    <h3>Sticking strings together</h3>
    <p>
      You can combine multiple columns into one column. For student coaches it
      is useful that the name of an OPO is always followed by the number of SP
      in parentheses, such as, e.g., "Database Foundations (6)."
    </p>
    <p>
      The double 'pipe' character (<code>||</code>) allows you to put columns
      and text to each other. The requested combination of name and SP can be
      realized by the following query. Pay attention to the difference between
      single and double quotes.
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT opocode, name || &#39; (&#39; || studyponts || &#39;)&#39; AS &quot;OPO (studypoints)&quot;
FROM courseunit</code></pre>

    <h3>String functions</h3>
    <p>
      High time to take a quick look at the fantastic documentation of
      PostgreSQL review. It is very comprehensive. On some questions about SQL
      functions by the way, the lecturers will suggest you to look up the answer
      yourself in the documentation yourself. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>, then!
    </p>
    <p>
      I usually start at the index page<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bookindex.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bookindex.html</a>. At the 'S' of string, I find a number of references to<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-string.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-string.html</a>. Browse through the long list of features. We give two examples of
      string functions.
    </p>

    <h4>Switching between uppercase and lowercase letters</h4>
    <p>
      The functions <code>lower()</code> and <code>upper()</code> allow you to switch
      between lower case ('lower case', literally) and upper case ('upper case',
      literally upper case, see picture below for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case">origin</a> of these designations). Especially if we want to search in the next chapter
      for strings (in the <code>WHERE</code> clause) it is usually a safe option
      to convert everything to lowercase first because strings in SQL are case sensitive
      ('casesensitive'). The string 'Van Hee' is not the same as 'Van hee'.
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/select/letterkast.jpg" alt="">
      <figcaption>
        Photo: The most frequently used letters (that is, the lower case
        letters) are in the lower case, the less frequently used (uppercase
        letters) in the upper case.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The following query shows all names of OPOs in lowercase:

      <pre><code>SELECT opocode, lower(name)
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    </p>

    <h4>Substring</h4>

    <p>
      A second basic operation with strings is <em>select part of the string</em>. This can be done with the string function <code>substring()</code>. The
      following query returns only the digit part of the lecturer code (column
      coordinator), so without the 'u':
    </p>

    <pre><code>SELECT opocode, substring(coordinator from 2) -- don&#39;t start until letter 2 to the end
FROM courseunit</code></pre>

    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          You may have already noticed that all opo codes begin with 'MBI' (at
          least in the TI program anyway). All lecturers have a number that
          starts with 'u'. Write a query that shows the opo code and the
          coordinator, but without the initial letter(s) which are always the
          same as the figure below shows. Do you also pay attention to the
          column headings?
        </p>
        <figure class="center">
          <img src="../../assets/select/zonderbeginletters.png" width="300" alt="">
        </figure>
      </div>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT substring(opocode from 4) as &quot;short opocode&quot;,
  substring(coordinator from 2) &quot;lector(abbreviated)&quot;
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h3>CASE</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose: instead of a column of credits, we just want to show a column
      showing the values 'small' (for OPOs with 4 or less SP), 'medium' (OPOs
      with 5 or 6 SP) and 'large' for OPOs with more than 6 SP. That column will
      be based on the 'credits' column and will be created with a <code>CASE</code> structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      We refer to the documentation. Through the index page, we find 'CASE:
      conditional expressions' on the page<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-conditional.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-conditional.html</a>. You'll find the following structure (and examples) here:
    </p>
    <pre><code>CASE
  WHEN condition THEN result
  [WHEN ...]
  [ELSE result]
END</code></pre>
    <p>
      Applied to the requested query, that gives the following possible query:
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT name,
  CASE
    WHEN studypoints &lt;= 4 THEN &#39;short&#39;
    WHEN studypoints &lt;= 6 THEN &#39;middle&#39; -- checking &gt; 4 so no more
    ELSE &#39;great&#39;
  END AS size
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    <p>
      The first condition that is true causes a value to be assigned in the
      column. The rest of the lines in the <code>CASE</code> are then skipped. Also
      note that we use an alias (<code>AS</code>) because otherwise the column
      header otherwise just shows 'case'.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>White space</em> (indenting with tabs or spaces) is not important to the
      database server, but it is <em>important</em>. important for people who
      have to read your code
    </p> (such as lecturers who need to correct your assignments :-).

    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          OPOs that do not have an end date are called 'new' OPOs in contrast to
          the 'old' OPOs that are no longer given and have an end date in our
          table. Write the query that generates the result of figure below. Need
          we say more? Note the column headings ...
        </p>
        <figure class="center">
          <img src="../../assets/select/oudnieuw.png" alt="nieuwe kolom met de tekst oud of nieuw" width="400">

        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">

    ELSE &#39;old&#39;
  END AS &quot;oud of new&quot;
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h2>Distinct</h2>
    <p>
      List all the possible languages used in the table are used in OPOs. The
      query for this is not difficult to set up:
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT languagecourseunit
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    <p>
      The result contains as many rows as there are rows in the table. That is
      not really what we want. To avoid <em>repetition</em> use<code>DISTINCT</code>behind the word<code>SELECT</code>:
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT languagecourseunit
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    <p>
      Attention: the <em>full</em> combination of all columns that come after the
      word
      <code>DISTINCT</code> must be different. Adjust the query To:
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT languagecourseunit, coordinator
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    <p>
      We now get more rows than before, but less than the full number of rows
      because some coordinators have multiple OPOs in the same language have.
      For example, check in the original full table that coordinator 'u0012047'
      appears three times with language dutch. The combination of language and
      coordinator is thus the same three times. By using the keyword <code>DISTINCT</code> this row will be shown only once.
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        Generate a list with per OPO each lecturer and the number of SP from
        each OPO. Count how many rows there are. Now make sure that there are no
        duplicates in this list, so if lecturer u0012047 gives two OPOs of 6 SP
        should this row be in the list only once.

    <h2>Working with a date</h2>
    <p>
      The data type <code>date</code> is very important in a database. Not for reason
      there are dozens of functions that can manipulate a date. We will look only
      a few of them here. Moreover, there is not only <code>date</code> as a datatype,
      but also <code>timestamp</code>, <code>time</code> and <code>interval</code>
      (see documentation at<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, we limit ourselves to the data type <code>date</code>. The<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html">documentation</a> provides an overview of the <code>date/time</code> functions that PostgreSQL
      offers.
    </p>

    <h3>Extract … from</h3>
    <p>
      A date contains the year, month and day. A time additionally includes
      hours, minutes, seconds, etc. With the function<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT"><code>EXTRACT</code></a> you can extract a piece from a date (or time). A small example from the OPO
      list to clarify this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT opocode, EXTRACT(year FROM fromdate) AS &quot;start academicyear&quot;
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    <p>
      This query displays a list of all OPOs with code and the year in which
      that OPO was first given. The list of possibilities is quite extensive:
      month, week, day, hour, ... (see<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-EXTRACT">documentation</a>).
    </p>

    <h3>Calculating with a date</h3>
    <p>
      You can increase or decrease a date by an integer, subtract dates from
      each other subtract dates from each other, etc.(<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html">documentation</a>).
    </p>

    <h4>Example 1: subtracting dates from each other</h4>
    <p>
      The following query calculates for each OPO how many days it will run or
      has been running. Of course, if we do not know end date, the result cannot
      cannot be calculated and you get the value<code>NULL</code>:
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT opocode, todate - fromdate AS &quot;quantity of days&quot;
FROM courseunit</code></pre>
    <p>
      Apparently, the OPO with code 'MBI68A' is the box with the longest
      duration, viz. 5477 days.
    </p>

    <h4>Example 2: functions age() and now()</h4>
    <p>
      A second example shows two functions: <code>age()</code> and <code>now()</code>. How old am I today if I was born on May 7, 1967?
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT age(now(),&#39;1967-05-07&#39;)
-- alternative is: SELECT age(CURRENT_DATE, &#39;1967-05-07&#39;)
-- second alternative: SELECT age(timestamp &#39;1967-05-07&#39;)</code></pre>

    <h2>Changing data type</h2>
    <p>
      A classic problem in typed programming languages is converting a value to
      another data type. You want to add an integer to a comma number, convert a
      number to a string, ... In English, one speaks One then speaks about 'to
      cast'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last example in the previous particle in which the age was calculated
      was an example of an <em>automatic cast</em>. According to the
      documentation that we have already referred to a few times, the function <code>age()</code>in the first version of the query operates on two <code>timestamps</code>. We however, wrote <code>age(now(),'1967-05-07')</code>. The function <code>now()</code> returns a <code>timestamp</code>, but the second argument ('1967-05-07')
      is a <code>date</code> and not a <code>timestamp</code>. PostgreSQL,
      however, will silently turn this <code>date</code> into a <code>timestamp</code> (by taking midnight as the time).
    </p>

    <h3>CAST … AS</h3>
    <p>
      Often, however, you have to <em>self</em> cast values. This can be done with
      two types of syntax: either with the <code>CAST(... AS ...)</code> function,
      or with the notation
      <code>::</code>. We give some simple examples:
    </p>
    <pre><code>-- cast a string to an integer
SELECT CAST(&#39;123&#39; AS integer)
SELECT &#39;123&#39;::integer -- different notation, but does the same thing as the CAST

-- cast an integer to a numeric
SELECT CAST(1234 AS numeric(8,3))
SELECT 1234::numeric(8,3) -- different notation, but does the same thing

-- a number to a string
SELECT CAST(1234 AS char(6)). -- make the string &#39;1234 &#39;</code></pre>

    <h3>TO_CHAR</h3>
    <p>
      The last example above (number to string) is a bit odd. Usually you want
      to convert the values in a column to a string <em>with a certain format</em>, e.g. a date in European notation with slashes between day, month and
      year. To do this, the function <code>TO_CHAR()</code> exists (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/functions-formatting.html">documentation</a>). Some examples:
    </p>
    <pre><code>SELECT TO_CHAR(date &#39;1967-05-07&#39;, &#39;dd/mm/yyyy&#39;); -- results: &#39;07/05/1967&#39;
SELECT TO_CHAR(date &#39;1967-05-07&#39;, &#39;day dd month yyyy&#39;); -- results: &#39;sunday 07 may 1967&#39;
SELECT TO_CHAR(148.5, &#39;9999.9999&#39;); -- give the string &#39; 148.5000&#39;</code></pre>
  </main>
