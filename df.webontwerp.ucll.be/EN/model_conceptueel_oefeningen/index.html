    <h1>Conceptual data model: exercises</h1>
    <p>
      The exercises below allow you to practice creating conceptual data models.
      For the different exercises we give a model solution each time.
    </p>

    <h2>Exercise 1: youth club: entity types</h2>
    <p>
      Below you get the description of how a youth club could potentialle work.
      This story will be used for the following exercises. You will successively
      look for entity types, attributes and relationships. In this section, we
      will first restrict ourselves to entity types.
    </p>

    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          Read the description below thoroughly and try to identify the entity
          types.
        </p>
        <p>
          A youth club wants to set up a database, to support its membership
          administration and activity planning. At initial registration, each
          member is given a unique member number. Information such as name,
          first name, address, email address, gender and date of birth are
          recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our members must re-register every year, a registration is thus valid
          for one year. Membership fees are also paid annually to cover
          insurance costs, for example. This is a different amount every year,
          the important thing is to know which members have paid their
          registration fee, and which have not yet done so. At the moment an
          enrolment happens, the member is placed in a certain age group, for
          example '6 to 9 year olds', '10 to 12 year olds', ... The age class is
          determined on the basis of the age of the member at the start of the
          new year.
        </p>
        <p>
          After registration, members are added to a group. With a lot of
          registrations within a particular age group, it is possible that for a
          given age group multiple groups are created. The groups themselves
          choose a name that they will use throughout the year. Just like the
          registration, this is revisited every year and the division remade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each group will have one designated member who will take on the role
          of 'leader' of the group. In addition, each group may have additional
          'co-leader', which will be one or more members who will support the
          'main' leader. The age of the leaders should obviously not match the
          age range of the group, that would be somewhat inappropriate.
          Leadership is redefined every year, and therefore applies for the
          lifetime of a group. Members can take charge of a maximum of one
          group, this applies to both 'leaders' and 'co-leaders'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaders organise certain activities for their groups which together
          form the group's annual schedule. Each activity is scheduled on a
          certain date and location. The same activity can be scheduled for
          several groups at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use a list of possible activities that are are described in a long
          list. This list contains for each activity, for example 'Swimming',
          what members should bring, how long it takes and certain things to
          take into account. The list of possible activities is completed and
          then used to plan activities. The list is then also used to
          communicate to members and their parents.
        </p>
        <p>
          The responsibility for coordinating these activities lies with the
          'leader'. The email address of the leader will be communicated so that
          members and parents can ask questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the system is to keep track of membership records where
          we want to be able to answer the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What groups do we have?</li>
          <li>What members do we have this year?</li>
          <li>What members did we have last year?</li>
          <li>What members do we have from a certain age group?</li>
          <li>What members have paid registration fees?</li>
          <li>Which members are in which group?</li>
          <li>What leadership do we have?</li>
          <li>Who leads which group?</li>
          <li>What activities are planned for a particular group?</li>
          <li>Who is responsible for coordinating the planned activities?</li>
          <li>When are the different activities planned?</li>

    <h2>Exercise 2: youth club: attributes</h2>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          Go back to conceptual.1 and determine for each of the entity types
          which attributes you find in the text. The attributes should allow you
          to describe the entities. Ask yourself the following questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>What properties should I track for each of the entity types?</li>
          <li>
            What information is necessary for my application? Can I find this
            information in the attributes?
          </li>
          <li>
            Are certain entity types missing to structure the necessary data? Is
            it difficult to place certain attributes with the entity types you
            have identified?
          </li>
          <li>
            Are there certain entity types that only have one attribute? Are we
            sure that this is an entity type with one attribute, or an attribute
            of another entity type? For example, if we want to keep track of a
            person's age, then we could identify an entity type 'Age' with the
            attribute 'Age'. On the other hand, this could also simply be an
            attribute of the entity type 'Person', without making our data model
            unnecessarily complex.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Expand your ERD in draw.io with your attributes. (TIP: you can
          duplicate a tab in diagrams.net. You can then build on the answer of a
          previous question, without losing the answer to the first question).

          Build on the results of exercise conceptual.2 and explore for the
          various relationships that exist between entity types. Describe the
          relationships with a clear name and specify the cardinality for each
          of the relationship's entity types. Ask the following questions when
          doing so:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do the relationships allow all the links and information to be
            incorporated?

          the tournament. Members sign up for the tournament. On
          basis of the entries, competitions are organised. Each
          match is scheduled at a specific date and time
          scheduled. The competitions take place at the association centre. Each
          table has a number. For the matches keep track of which table
          the match is scheduled. Each match is played by a number
          of the members of the association. At each match, one of the
          members takes the role of gamekeeper. This person is responsible for recording the
          individual scores of the players. The members are
          registered in the system so that they can participate in matches
          and take up the role of game leader. For each member, we keep name,
          e-mail address and date of birth. Members can introduce other members
          apply. We have a catalogue of games that we use to organise the
          tournaments and competitions. Of each game, we need to know the
          name, the number of players and the edition. A board game can either be a
          base game, or an expansion. If it is an
          expansion, we want to know from which base game it is an expansion
          is. Of each board game, we want a list of members who
          can lead games of the board game. At any time, we need to
          be able to create an overview of:
