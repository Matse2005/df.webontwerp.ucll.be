    <h2>The need for an OUTER JOIN</h2>
    <p>Make the following exercise as an introduction.</p>

    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          Our program manager would like an overview of all lecturers
          with their lecturer number, first name, surname and the name of the OPO of which they are
          coordinator. Sort by last name alphabetically. You should obtain the
          figure obtained below.

          Not so difficult: <pre><code>SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, OPO.naam
FROM lector L INNER JOIN opleidingsonderdeel OPO ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator
ORDER BY 3</code></pre>
        </p>
      </div>
      
</section>
    <p>
      We go over again the steps the RDBMS takes when executing
      this query:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, the <code>FROM</code> is executed. This is a <code>INNER JOIN</code>of two tables and so the cartesian product is created first: each
        row of the lector table is linked to each row of the OPO table.
      </li>
      <li>
        Not all combinations in this cartesian product are <em>sense</em>:
        only those where the lecturer number (in one table called 'lector_id',
        in the other 'coordinator') match are retained, because those
        satisfy the join condition ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no <code>WHERE</code> component, so no more rows are dropped
        from the result.
      </li>
      <li>The <code>GROUP BY</code> (and <code>HAVING</code>) is also missing.</li>
      <li>
        Finally, the result rows are arranged alphabetically by
        surname via the <code>ORDER BY</code> component.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      You draw proudly with the requested list to the training manager,
      who unfortunately is not entirely satisfied with the result. "I wanted
      actually that <em>all</em> lecturers be in the list, including those who are not
      any OPO coordinator" you can hear him say. The <code>INNER JOIN</code>
      in your SQL query, however, shows <em>only</em> the lecturers that appear in both tables
      occur, i.e., only the coordinators of OPOs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you still want to include <em>all</em> professors in the list, the missing
      lecturers must be <em>added</em> to the result of the <code>INNER JOIN</code>. This is exactly what an
      <code>OUTER JOIN</code> does. You just need to replace the word <code>INNER</code> with
      replace with
      <code>LEFT OUTER</code> or <code>RIGHT OUTER</code> (or possibly <code>FULL OUTER</code>):<pre><code>SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, OPO.naam
FROM lector L LEFT OUTER JOIN opleidingsonderdeel OPO ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator
ORDER BY 3</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why <code>LEFT</code>? This join contains two tables: one <em>left</em> of the word <code>JOIN</code> (i.e. 'lecturer') and one <em>right</em>
      of the word JOIN (i.e. 'course unit'). After the ordinary <code>INNER JOIN</code> some lecturers are still missing from the lecture table. Because that table is to the left of
      the word
      <code>JOIN</code>, this thus becomes a <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This code is completely equivalent to this variant:<pre><code>SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, OPO.naam
FROM opleidingsonderdeel OPO RIGHT OUTER JOIN lector L ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator
ORDER BY 3</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, we simply swapped the order in which the two tables are written
      are written. This does not affect the <code>INNER JOIN</code>which happens first, but you must therefore replace the word <code>LEFT</code>
      with <code>RIGHT</code>. The following figure shows the result. In
      comparison with the earlier figure, a <em>number of rows added</em>. For example, there is lector Elke Crabbé who is not coordinator of any OPO.
      Since she does not appear in the table 'course unit', there is also
      no information about the name of the OPO. <em>This is why there is null (no value) in the last column</em> (<span style="color:orange">oranje line</span>).
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/join/outerjoin_2.png" width="600" alt="">
    </figure>

    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          Explain why the following two queries return the exact same result: <pre><code>-- query 1
SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, OPO.naam
FROM opleidingsonderdeel OPO LEFT OUTER JOIN lector L ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator
ORDER BY 3

-- query 2
SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, OPO.naam
FROM opleidingsonderdeel OPO INNER JOIN lector L ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator
ORDER BY 3</code></pre>
        </p>

        <div class="oplossing">
        <p>
          From query 2 with the <code>INNER JOIN</code> you already know the result. Query
          1 is a <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code>. <strong>.
            Each <code>OUTER JOIN</code> starts first as a regular <code>INNER JOIN</code>
          </strong>. Once that is done, it looks at which rows from the
          left table are missing. Those are then added. Here, however, the
          left table, however, is the "course section" table. <em>Every</em> row of
          this table is already represented in the <code>INNER JOIN</code> (why?),
          so no more rows are added. Both queries therefore return
          the same result.
        </p>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h2>JOIN and GROUP BY</h2>
    <p>
      <code>JOIN</code> can be combined with other components without any problem,
      so also with <code>GROUP BY</code> and <code>HAVING</code>.
    </p>

    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        We will work out the following example. Will you try all the steps yourself? There
        will go wrong several times. Always find the mistake first.
      </p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        
      
</section>
    <p>
      List all teachers with the number of OPOs for which they are
      coordinator. Even lecturers who are not coordinators of any OPO,
      should be included in the list. Sort the list alphabetically by name.
    </p>
    <p>Analyze the task:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You need to combine information from the lector table and the OPO table, so we
        need an <code>(INNER) JOIN</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The sentence "also lecturers who are not coordinators of any OPO ..." points
        to an <code>OUTER JOIN</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Per lector</em> summary information should be given, so
        we need a
        <code>GROUP BY</code>.
      </li>
      <li>Counting numbers is done with <code>COUNT()</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To predict what we should obtain, we start from the
      known code that generated the figure in the section above:<pre><code>SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, OPO.naam
FROM opleidingsonderdeel OPO RIGHT OUTER JOIN lector L ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator
ORDER BY 3</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      See the list in that figure. Lecturer 'Gerben Adriaens' is from one OPO
      coordinator, 'Goedele Bogers' of two, 'Elke Crabbé' none etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Customize this code with a <code>GROUP BY</code>:<pre><code>SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, OPO.naam
FROM opleidingsonderdeel OPO RIGHT OUTER JOIN lector L ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator
GROUP BY lector_id
ORDER BY 3</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      You get an error message (think for a moment why):<pre><code>ERROR: column &quot;opo.naam&quot; must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used
in an aggregate function
LINE 2: SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, OPO.naam</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is there an error message about 'OPO.name'? If you use the<a href="../SQL_groupby_having/index.html">chapter on GROUP BY</a> processed, you should be able to provide the answer to that question. <em>By grouping the information into boxes per lecturer, the
      detailed information about the OPOs is lost</em>. The only thing you can still retrieve is information from the so-called
    'aggregation functions' <code>MIN()</code>, <code>MAX()</code>, <code>AVG()</code>, <code>COUNT()</code> and <code>SUM()</code>.
    </p>
    <section class="opgepast">
      <p>
        Something strange is going on, however. Why is there no error message
        about L.first name and L.name? We had explained that in the <code>SELECT</code> can only list the columns that are in the <code>GROUP BY</code> (and
        aggregation functions as well)? Then why do you get <em>no</em> error message for
        L.first name and L.name?
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason is that here you <em>group</em> on the primary key of the
        lector table. So you are sure that one box will be created per lector.
        In that box there is only one lecturer name, lecturer first name, etc., but multiple
        OPOs. Therefore, you can retrieve the columns L.name and L.first name, but
        not OPO.name.
      </p>
    </section>
    <p>
      So you have to use an aggregation function in the code. In this case
      That's counting a number of times something occurs, so a <code>COUNT()</code>. Modify the code to:<pre><code>SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, COUNT(*)
FROM opleidingsonderdeel OPO RIGHT OUTER JOIN lector L ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator
GROUP BY lector_id
ORDER BY 3</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>You obtain this <em>(error!)</em>result:</p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/join/outerjoin_3.png" width="600" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>
      There is a problem with this figure (and thus with our code). Compare for a moment
      with the previous figure. Gerben does have 1 OPO, Goedele is
      coordinator of two OPOs, but Elke Crabbé is not the coordinator of any OPO.
      coordinator. However, the result of our code is that Elke Crabbé is coordinator of one
      OPO coordinator (see<span style="color: orange">orange arrow</span>
      in the figure). What goes wrong?
    </p>
    <section class="opgepast">
      <p>
        The error is in the aggregation function <code>COUNT(*)</code>. This
        function (with <code>*</code>) <em>counts all rows, including those with one or more <code>NULL</code> values</em>. So the row containing Elke Crabbé's info is effectively counted. This
        problem is fortunately easy to solve. Instead of the <code>*</code> enter <em>the column of interest for what you want to count</em>. Specifically, here we are talking about 'OPO.name'. A value <code>NULL</code> in this field will not count. So you end the <code>SELECT</code> with <code>COUNT(OPO.name)</code>:<pre><code>SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, COUNT(OPO.naam)
FROM opleidingsonderdeel OPO RIGHT OUTER JOIN lector L ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator
GROUP BY lector_id
ORDER BY 3</code></pre>
      </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Select rows that do NOT meet a certain condition</h2>.
    
    <p>
      Note: This is a <strong>quite difficult piece</strong>.
      Exercises that rely on this principle are quite tough!
    </p>
    <p>
      You get a new question from the training manager: "I would like
      like a list of all professors who are NOT coordinators of one or
      multiple OPOs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Piece of cake, of course! With the <code>OUTER JOIN</code> of previous
      section you got a list of all coordinators, supplemented by the lecturers
      who do not appear in the OPO table and thus are not coordinators. Those "added
      lecturers you recognize by the absence of a value for the column with the OPO name.
      Filtering rows after running the <code>FROM</code> is done with the <code>WHERE</code> component. The query thus becomes:<pre><code>SELECT lector_id, L.voornaam, L.naam, OPO.naam
FROM lector L LEFT OUTER JOIN opleidingsonderdeel OPO ON L.lector_id = OPO.coordinator
WHERE naam = NULL -- principe is OK, code niet! Zie opdracht hieronder
ORDER BY 3</code></pre>
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        We intentionally put two errors in the <code>WHERE</code> component of the above
        query. Correct those so that the query is executed correctly and you
        obtain a list of four lectors: Elke, Maarten, Patrick and Lut.</p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <p>
          Error 1: "name" is ambiguous. Is it referring to the name of the lecturer or
          the name of the OPO? Second error: comparing with <code>NULL</code> should
          never with '=' but must be with the word 'IS'. The correct <code>WHERE</code> component is: <code>WHERE OPO.name IS NULL</code>.
        </p>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h3>Exercise</h3>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          List all professors who are not coordinators of an OPO
          that has 6 SP. Order alphabetically by name and then by first name. Your
          should obtain the result from this figure:

          Tip: start this exercise with more columns than just first name and last name
          (possibly even with all columns!). First, create an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. Look at the result. Now transform your query into a <code>OUTER JOIN</code> and see what was added.
        </p>
        <pre><code>SELECT l.naam, l.voornaam
FROM opleidingsonderdeel o RIGHT OUTER JOIN lector l ON
  o.coordinator = l.lector_id AND o.studiepunten = 6
WHERE o.studiepunten IS NULL
ORDER BY 1, 2</code></pre>

</section>

    <h2>FULL OUTER JOIN</h2>
    <p>
      It was explained above that an <code>OUTER JOIN</code> is a <code>INNER JOIN</code> is where all missing elements from one table (those attached to the <code>LEFT</code> or the <code>RIGHT</code> side) are added. There is also a <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code> which essentially <em> means
        means adding the missing elements from both the left
        and the right table
      </em>. In our example with only two tables (lecturers and OPOs)
      however, we cannot create a meaningful <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code>. This will be
      covered later in the exercises. In the video at the beginning of this chapter
      does explain it well.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary overview JOIN</h2>
    <p>
      Below is another overview of all the different types of <code>JOIN</code>
      that we have seen. For each type we list how the set of rows that
      the rest of the query is run with is constructed.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Implicit JOIN <code>A,B</code>: Each row of table A is
        combined with each row of table B.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>A INNER JOIN B</code>: Each row of table A is combined with
        each row of table B where the combination satisfies the
        join condition.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>A LEFT OUTER JOIN B</code>: Each row of table A is
        combined with each row of table B where the combination satisfies
        the join condition. Here, all rows of table A that do not
        satisfy the join condition supplemented by null values for all
        columns of table B.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>A RIGHT OUTER JOIN B</code>: Each row of table A is
        combined with each row of table B where the combination satisfies
        the join condition. Here, all rows of table B that do not
        satisfy the join condition supplemented by null values for all
