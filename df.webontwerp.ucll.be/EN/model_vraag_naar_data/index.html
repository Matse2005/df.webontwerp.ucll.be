    <h1>From demand to data</h1>
    
    <p>
      In this chapter, we want to take a brief look at how datasets and databases
      are created. You should remember the following from this chapter:
    </p>

    <section class="leerdoel">
      <ul>
        <li>data modeling as a step in the analysis of IT applications;</li>
        <li>a step-by-step approach to database development;</li>
        <li>conceptual, logical and physical data model;</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h2>Start with a question</h2>
    
    <p>
      In <a href="../SQL_intro/index.html">the introductory chapter SQL</a> we have already
      briefly explained how, using SQL, we can query an existing dataset
      query. In the following chapters we will go into more detail about the
      possibilities that SQL has to offer. In parallel, we want to
      explain, namely <em>building datasets and databases</em>. We
      address the following questions:
      </p><ul>
        <li>how do datasets and databases come about?</li>
        <li>what process leads to a well-built database?</li>
        <li>what determines whether a database is well built?</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      Before looking at how datasets and databases are created, we consider
      we look at a similar process, namely building a house. Suppose you
      would like to have a house built, how do you proceed? In the first
      initially, you start with <em>a question or need</em> to build something. You want to
      build a house for your family, for example. As soon as you know you are going to have a
      house, you contact an <em>architect</em>. The
      architect will start thinking with you of exactly what needs to be built
      be built, by asking a lot of questions to fully understand what your house
      should look like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the architect, using his technical
      expertise, is going to ensure that while designing the house, a number of <em>basic principles and good practices</em>
      are respected. After your consultation, the architect draws a floor plan.
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/vraag_naar_data/grondplan.jpg" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>
      This floor plan is <em>discussed</em> with you to ensure that the
      architect's interpretation matches your expectations. In later stages
      phases, the architect will make more detailed versions of this plan so that
      contractors, electricians, plumbers, ... know how your house should be made.
      This detailed floor plan is kept well in order to have an overview of where
      certain construction elements (water pipes, electricity, support beams,
      ...) are located.
    </p>

    <h2>Request for data</h2>
    
    <p>
      For building a database, the process is similar. <em>
        A database typically starts with a request to keep track of data</em>, for example, data collected within software. An architect
      (we have those in IT, too) or an analyst will work with users and
      developers to consider what data should go into a database.
      Based on those conversations, the analyst will draw up a <em>data model</em> drawn out that is discussed with the relevant parties.
    </p><p>
      This model is then further detailed in a number of steps into
      a <em>building plan</em> for a database. This building plan allows the developers
      of the database to build the database. It also allows the developers of
      the software to start developing the application.
      Because once the structure of the database is agreed upon, you can
      as a developer write your code that will work with this structure,
      without the database being built. Later when the database is built, you can
      the code <em>tested</em>. Finally, the models are an important
      source for
      <em>documentation</em> for analysts and developers for the <em>further</em>
        further development and maintenance of the systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Analysis</h2>

    <p>
      The development of an IT solution (ideally) follows a
      roadmap. There are a lot of different standardized
      variants of such a roadmap, what we will call later in the course
      development methodologies later in the course. A development methodology
      can be linear or iterative, and consists of a number of stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important phase that recurs in just about every development methodology for IT
      applications is the analysis phase or <em>analysis</em> for short.
      Within the analysis phase, we are going to translate the demand for an IT application
      to a number of functional and technical requirements. The result of
      this phase we call the <em>(requirement-)analysis.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Analysis is an essential phase in which we identify the problem, the process to be
      automate process, the underlying logic, ... try to properly
      understand before we start the implementation. In this phase, we will
      go through documentation, conduct interviews, organize workshops, ... to
      gather information ourselves. Then we are going to structure that information in a
      certain way to structure that information. There are many different methods
      used within an analysis, some of which you will
      will discover within this OPO and in further training.
    </p>

    <p>
      The sub-process of the analysis in which we identify the <em>the</em>
        requirements for information and consequently data mapping, we call
      <em>data modeling.</em> As a component for software demand, we are going to
      evaluate what demand exists to track data persistently.
    </p>

    <p>
      In later courses, the concept of
      development methodology. You will explore different variants (including agile,
      DevOps, waterfall, rapid application development) more in depth
      study.
    </p>

    <h2>Data modeling</h2>
    <p>
      Data modeling proceeds in a number of steps. In each step, we try to
      answer a particular question (the specific questions are discussed below
      discussed below). The result of each step results in a data model, in which
      we may or may not build on a data model from a previous step. <em>
        Each step results in a data model and associated documentation</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A data model is <em>
        a visual and schematic representation of the data we want to include in a
        database.
      </em> It contains the various pieces of data that make up the database
      and the relationships that exist between these pieces. To draw out the data model
      draw, we use a <em>standardized notation.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      There are certain advantages to using a standardized
      notation. First, it promotes the <em>readability</em> of the
      data model. If there are clear agreements about which symbols are used
      and how to interpret them, anyone familiar with the notation can read the data model
      read and interpret the data model. Data models can thus be easily exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second advantage is that the notation was developed to <em>present complex concepts in a simple way.</em> It simplifies and speeds up the design of a data model. Add to this
      add to this the fact that there are a lot of tools that allow you to digitally
      create them, and you can proceed quickly and efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since data modeling of a database is done in steps, and each
      step results in a data model, we will have multiple
      data models. We are talking about layers here where each data model forms a
      particular layer and, as mentioned earlier, answers a particular question.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our process we distinguish three types (layers) of data models:
      conceptual, logical and physical.
    </p>

    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/vraag_naar_data/datamodel-lagen.png" alt="Lagen datamodel">
    </figure>

    <h3>Conceptual data model</h3>.
    
    <p>
      The first step is to draw out a conceptual data model in which we
      define an answer to the question <em>
        "What information is relevant to the intended IT application?"</em>. In this data model, we create a picture on the reality of the users <em>
        without including technical details or technical limitations
        into account</em>. Instead, the focus is on the relevant concepts and business logic
      ('business logic').
    </p><p>
      The conceptual data model also allows the scope ('scope') of the
      data model to be well delineated, so that all involved have a clear view
      of what is of interest. It provides a view on what is included in the
      application, and what is not included.
    </p>

    <p>
      In drawing out the conceptual model, we try to answer the following
      questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>what concepts</em> are important to our application?</li>
      <li><em>how</em> are we going to <em>describe</em> those concepts?</li>
      <li>what <em>connections</em> are there between these concepts?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The conceptual data model typically emerges as a <em>collaboration</em> between analysts and users.
        collaboration between analysts and users. During workshops, interviews, etc., the users describe what
      information is relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The analyst collects this information and compiles it into a conceptual
      data model. This data model serves as <em>
        a means of communication between the various parties involved</em>. The simple nature of the conceptual data model allows
      users easily evaluate whether the analysts' interpretation is
      correct. On the other hand, it contains enough information for the analysts to
      work on this further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very important: at this level, there is still <em>no</em> talk about technology,
      just high-level what information is relevant to the users. This is what makes
      the conceptual data model also so valuable: after this step, the development team
      of the application can still go in any direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conceptual data model below tells the following story: "A student
      (with some data such as r-number etc.) takes at least one OPO,
      while this OPO (code, number of credits SP etc.) can be taken by multiple
      students. It is also possible that there is an OPO
      that is not chosen by any student.". This drawing can also be
      read by non-technical people and can thus serve as a basis for
      a conversation.
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/vraag_naar_data/studentOPOconceptueel.svg" alt="">
    </figure>

    <p>
      <a href="../model_conceptueel/index.html">
        We will go into more detail later about the conceptual data model and how it is created
        established.
      </a>
    </p>

    <h3>Logical data model</h3>.
    
    <p>
      Once we have a view of the information and consequently the concrete data
      facts or data relevant to the users, we try to answer the
      following question:<em>
        "Which database model is best suited for the development of our
        database?"</em>. In fact, there are several data<em>bank</em> models (not to be
      confused with data models) where each of the database models defines a way
      defines a way to structure data. Each database model has its advantages and
      disadvantages or specific applications, and proper consideration is
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The choice of a particular database model is typically made in
      consultation between the analysts (with visibility into the data being modeled
      being modeled), the architect (with visibility into the broad technical environment in which the
      application will be developed) and the developers (with visibility into the
      technology that will be used for the application). The impact of the
      choice is not only relevant to the database, but <em>it
        also imposes constraints on the DBMS and technology that will be used
        are</em>.
    </p><p>
      After choosing a particular database model <em>the analyst <em>translates</em> taking into account the specific rules of the database model. Some
      database models, for example, are going to place a constraint on the type of relationships
      that can exist between the data. In this case, during the conversion we are going to
      convert the unsupported types of relationships to relationship types that are
      supported. No doubt this all sounds a bit abstract, but we
      will come back to this in detail later.
    </em></p><em>
    </em><p><em>
      In quite a few cases, a <em>customized</em> relational database model will be chosen.
        relational database model</em>. Therefore, in the case of this choice, the logical data model is called a
      <em>relational data model</em>. We focus within this box on
      the relational database model and will come back to this in detail in a later chapter
      on this.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following figure you will find the translation of the conceptual model into
      a logical model. A relational model was chosen. It is already a
      lot more technical (three tables, primary and foreign key, ... see
      later), but still leaves out certain details because it is not yet
      specifically chosen which DBMS to use.
    </p>
    <figure class="center">
      <img src="../../assets/vraag_naar_data/studentOPOlogisch.svg" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>
      Standards are also defined for relational data models; we call
      these <em>normalities</em>. There are different levels of
      normal forms. Each normal form consists of a number of technical
      criteria. Each level imposes additional criteria. A data model that meets the
      criteria of a normal form satisfies the normal form. The
      criteria are defined to prevent possible errors in the use of the
      database. Thus, by indicating that a data model follows a certain
      normal form, you thus provide a guarantee that certain rules within the
      data model are respected. We will come back to this later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The logical data model is just because of its conversion to a specific
      database model <em>already a bit more technical</em> than the conceptual data model.
      This also makes the readability of the data model a bit more difficult for non-IT
      contributors. Nevertheless, the data model still <em>contains</em>
        too little technical information for the developers
       of the database, so that an additional step is needed, namely the conversion
      for a specific DBMS. So on to the physical data model ...
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="../model_logisch/index.html">A full chapter is also devoted to the logic model.</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Physical data model</h3>
    <p>
      The final step focuses on the question <em>.
        "Which DBMS are we going to use to store the data?"</em>. In the development of the physical data model, decisions are made
      how the data will be physically structured within the database, taking into account
      consideration of the chosen DBMS. Each DBMS has its own set of capabilities
      and challenges that a development team can take advantage of or must
      into account. In addition, there are also many considerations
      performance, security, ... All of these technical
      decisions come together in the physical data model.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        In this phase, architects, database administrators and developers will
        evaluate which DBMS will be used</em>. In a lot of cases, this choice is already fixed since most
      organizations have already made a choice in their architecture. The
      combining different DBMS in the same architecture means
      additional complexity and cost, so that is avoided in most cases
      avoided whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a DBMS is chosen, database administrators
      and developers evaluate the <em>structure</em> of the database and establish <em>technical
        technical details</em> determine how specifically the data will be stored. This analysis results
      in the physical data model that contains all this information. The physical data model
      allows the developers to implement the necessary structures and build the
      database.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last figure translates the previous (logical) relational data model
      into a physical data model specific to PostgreSQL. The drawing now includes
      also concrete details, such as data types (<code>char(8)</code>, <code>smallint</code>, ...). By the way, it was created with another tool, which can communicate with a specific
      server to communicate with (DBSchema, see later).
