    <h1>Combining tables with INNER JOIN</h1>
    <p>
      In previous chapters, all components of a <code>SELECT</code> query have been
      have been reviewed, except for one: the <code>FROM</code> component. There was
      much to say about it either, since we only had one table anyway. In
      this section, we use multiple tables in a query.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next video explains the principles of <em>the cartesian product</em> and <em>join</em>well explained. Watch it first, then follow the text below and do the exercises
      found in the text.
    </p>

    <h2>Implicit JOIN</h2>
    <p>
      We'll use a simple example to explain the principle. Suppose
      that you want a list of the mail addresses of all OPO coordinators as
      in the figure below. After the <a href="../../NL/SQL_anopveel/index.html">previous chapter</a> you should have two linked tables in your own schema: '‘lector’'
      and ‘opleidingsonderdeel’.


    </p>
    <figure class="center">

    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        Now work out the following example by trying out the code of all the steps
        in your own schema. Do not forget to specify the name of your schema
        for each table, or set your search_path correctly. In the
        code examples below we chose the latter solution.

    <h3>Cartesian product of multiple tables</h3>
    <p>
      The lector table contains 18 rows, which you can easily do with a <code>COUNT(*)</code> can check:<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM lector</code></pre>
    </p>

    <section class="taak">
  <p>How many rows does the table contain ‘opleidingsonderdeel’?</p>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <p>This table contains 21 rows.</p>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <section class="taak">
  <p>
        Now try out the following code and try to figure out from the output
        figure out what it does:<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM lector, opleidingsonderdeel</code></pre>

        <div class="oplossing">
        <p>
          By specifying in the <code>FROM</code> component two tables (separated
          by a comma) <em>
            each row of the table becomes‘lector’ linked to each row of the
            second table ‘opleidingsonderdeel’
          </em>. Each of the 18 lecturer rows is thus combined with each of the
          21 OPOs. That gives a total of 18 × 21 = 378 rows in the result. Your
          will need the horizontal scroll bar in the result field, because
          these rows will be long since all the columns of both tables
          together are present in the result.
        </p>
      </div>
      
</section>
    <p>
      This product - a set in which each row from the first table occurs with
      each row from the second table - is called the <em>cartesian product</em>.
      called. Listing two tables after the word <code>FROM</code> is an
      <em>implicit</em> join. We will ask later to always use an <em>explicit</em>join, but for now we'll do it this way.
    </p>

    <h3>Selecting columns in the cartesian product</h3>
    <p>
      You know that the <code>FROM</code> component is always <em>be run first</em>. In this case, it loads the cartesian product of both tables into the
      working memory. The <code>SELECT</code> comes later. It selects certain
      columns.
    </p>
    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          Try this code:<pre><code>SELECT opocode, coordinator, lector_id, email
FROM lector, opleidingsonderdeel</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now suppose that, in addition to these four columns, you also want to show the name of the OPO
          to be displayed, a simple addition of this column in the<code>SELECT</code> … <pre><code>SELECT opocode, naam, coordinator, lector_id, email
FROM lector, opleidingsonderdeel</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          ... you would think. However, you get an error message:<pre><code>ERROR: column reference &quot;naam&quot; is ambiguous
LINE 2: SELECT opocode, naam,coordinator,lector_id,email</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          What goes wrong? Then modify the <code>SELECT</code> so that you also see the OPO name
          will also be displayed.
        </p>
      </div>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <p>
          

            The database server informs that the requested column 'naam'
            is ambiguous ('ambiguous'). In fact, there are two columns of 'name'.
            You can remove this ambiguity by prefixing the name of the column
            preceded by the name of the table, i.e. something in the style
            of <code>SELECT table name.column name</code>. <em>If there is no ambiguity, the column name is of course
              sufficient!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This could then be a possible solution:<pre><code>SELECT opocode, opleidingsonderdeel.naam, coordinator, lector_id, email
FROM lector, opleidingsonderdeel</code></pre>
        </p>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h3>Alias for table names</h3>
    <p>
      
      
      You should regularly specify the column by writing the table name in front of it.
      writing the table name in front of it. That's a fair amount of typing. A shorter option is to use
      of an <em>alias</em> (also called a "pseudonym"). You temporarily replace
      so to speak, temporarily replace the name of the table with something shorter (often only one or a
      few letters). Compare subsequent versions of the same query. First the long
      version:
      <pre><code>SELECT opocode, opleidingsonderdeel.naam, coordinator, lector_id, lector.naam, email
FROM lector, opleidingsonderdeel</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Shorter and therefore possibly easier to read is this version with two
      aliases:<pre><code>SELECT opocode, O.naam, coordinator, lector_id, L.naam, email
FROM lector AS L, opleidingsonderdeel AS O</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      You may possibly omit the word <code>AS</code> and so it can be a little more
      shorter:<pre><code>SELECT opocode, O.naam, coordinator, lector_id, L.naam, email
FROM lector L, opleidingsonderdeel O</code></pre>
    </p>

    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          Try making the combination where you define an <em>alias</em>,
          but still use the full name of the table in the<code>SELECT</code> By testing out the following code:<pre><code>SELECT opocode, opleidingsonderdeel.naam, coordinator, lector_id, L.naam, email
FROM lector L, opleidingsonderdeel O</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>What do you decide?</p>
      </div>
  
        <button>Show / hide solution</button>
        <div class="oplossing">
        <p>
          The error message will help you further:<pre><code>ERROR:  invalid reference to FROM-clause entry for table &quot;opleidingsonderdeel&quot;
LINE 2: SELECT opocode, opleidingsonderdeel.naam, coordinator, lecto...
                        ^
HINT:  Perhaps you meant to reference the table alias &quot;o&quot;.
SQL state: 42P01
Character: 50</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, this means that <em>once you have defined an alias for a table name, you are
            are obliged to use that alias</em>. At that point, the table name is temporarily replaced by the alias!
        </p>
      </div>
      
</section>

    <h3>Join condition</h3>
    <p>
      Because of the implicit join in the <code>FROM</code> component, you have the <em>cartesian product</em> created: a combination of each row of one table with each row of the
      second table. So a total of 378 combinations of rows. That long list must
      You must now limit that long list to the "meaningful" rows. Removing or keeping rows is done
      with a <code>WHERE</code>. This <code>WHERE</code> we call the 'join condition'
      or 'join condition'.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are the <em>sense</em> rows here? Each coordinator of each OPO will be
      paired with any lecturer. However, we were only looking for the
      email address of the coordinator. <em>The only meaningful rows then are those where the coordinator in the OPO table
        equals the lecturer_id in the lecturer table:</em><pre><code>SELECT opocode, email
FROM lector, opleidingsonderdeel
WHERE coordinator = lector_id -- join conditie</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the 378 rows in the cartesian product, only 21 satisfy this
      condition. This makes sense: there are 21 OPOs and each OPO has
      precisely one coordinator. <a href="#Implicit-JOIN">The figure at the beginning of this chapter</a> shows the result in pgAdmin.
    </p>

    <section class="taak">
  <div>
        <p>
          <em>
            This exercise covers a lot of things from previous chapters

          </em> Write the query that, for each OPO of less than 6 credits, returns the
          following: the name of the OPO, the number of credits, first name
          and last name of the coordinator in one column, and the year in which that OPO
          was first on the program of study. Sort according to
          increasing number of credits. For equal number of credits, continue
          sort according to year (newest first). You should obtain the following figure
          with a table of 13 rows.

        <div class="oplossing">
        <pre><code>SELECT O.naam AS OPOnaam, studiepunten, L.voornaam || &#39; &#39; || L.naam AS coordinator,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM O.van) as startjaar

WHERE coordinator = lector_id AND studiepunten &lt; 6
ORDER BY 2 ASC, 4 DESC</code></pre>

</section>

    <h2>Explicit JOIN</h2>
    

    The previous exercise exposes a <em>weakness of the implicit join</em> (multiple
      tables in the FROM separated by a comma). Both the join condition
      <code>(coordinator = lector_id)</code> and the 'normal' condition <code>(credits &lt; 6)</code> are in the <code>WHERE</code> component. An alternative notation exists
      for the
      <code>JOIN</code> where you explicitly name this operation that way.
    
    <p>
      The solution of the previous exercise then looks like this with an explicit <code>JOIN</code>:<pre><code>SELECT O.naam AS OPOnaam, studiepunten, L.voornaam || &#39; &#39; || L.naam AS coordinator,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM O.van) as startjaar
FROM lector L INNER JOIN opleidingsonderdeel O ON coordinator = lector_id  -- leesbaarder!
WHERE studiepunten &lt; 6
ORDER BY 2 ASC, 4 DESC</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      The join condition is now in the <code>FROM</code> and we explicitly state
      the word <code>JOIN</code>. This notation is more logical and you make less
      chance of forgetting the join condition or doing something wrong in the <code>WHERE</code>, because this component is now simpler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order in which you write the tables is not important. The word <code>INNER</code>you may also omit it. <em>We recommend always writing it anyway</em>. In fact, there is also an <code>OUTER JOIN</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also an alternative notation for the join condition that you can use
      use <em>if both columns in that condition have identically the same name and if
        you are testing for equality of both</em>. That is not the case in this example, but suppose that the column
      'coordinator' also had 'lector_id' as its name, then we would have written the above
      code written like this:<pre><code>SELECT O.naam AS OPOnaam, studiepunten, L.voornaam || &#39; &#39; || L.naam AS coordinator,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM O.van) as startjaar
FROM lector L INNER JOIN opleidingsonderdeel O ON O.lector_id = L.lector_id. -- alias nodig!
WHERE studiepunten &lt; 6
ORDER BY 2 ASC, 4 DESC</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be shorter by using<code>USING</code>:<pre><code>SELECT O.naam AS OPOnaam, studiepunten, L.voornaam || &#39; &#39; || L.naam AS coordinator,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM O.van) as startjaar
FROM lector L INNER JOIN opleidingsonderdeel O USING(lector_id)
WHERE studiepunten &lt; 6
ORDER BY 2 ASC, 4 DESC</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will return to this later in the exercises. The notation with <code>ON</code> is always usable, the one with <code>USING</code> only in certain cases.
    </p>

    <h2>Jointing a table with itself</h2>
    <p>
      In a <code>JOIN</code> operation, you combine two (or more) tables. You
      may also use <em>two times the same table</em>. The use of aliases
      is mandatory in this case. Try the following exercise using the tips.

    <p>A word about this model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The schedule contains three tables: 'game' (contains information about each
        game, such as time, stage and between which teams), 'eteam'
        (name and coach of each team) and finally a table 'goal' (who scored
        a goal in which minute for which team).
      </li>
      <li>
        Note that<span style="color:#00c">the primary key of the table 'goal'</span> is a <em>composite key</em> (twice PK in the table): after all, there may be
          multiple goals per match, after all, and so matchid alone would be
          be insufficient to uniquely specify a goal. The combination of matchid
          and gtime (minute in which the goal was scored) is unique (if you assume
          that goals cannot be scored twice in the same minute &#128512;).</li>
      <li>
        The table 'game' has<span style="color:#090">two foreign keys, numbered FK1 and FK2</span>. After all, a game is played between two teams, and each field
          ('team1' and 'team2') thus refers to a particular team about which you can find more
          information can be found in the table 'eteam').
      </li>
      <li>
        Moreover, you must be able to read the <em>cardinalities</em> well in this logical scheme
        be able to read. The <span style="color:#090">large green ellipse</span> tells
        you &ndash;if you look from 'eteam' to 'game'&ndash; that each team plays at least
        is playing one game. The <span style="color:#f80">smaller orange ellipse</span>indicates that a game is played by one unique team1 and one
        unique team2.
      </li>
      <li>
        Regarding the cardinalities of the relationship between the tables 'goal' and
        'eam': A team can score 0 or more goals in the tournament
        (<span style="color:#c00">red circle</span>) and a specific goal
        always belongs correctly to one team (<span style="color:#009">blue diamond</span>).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exercises on INNER JOIN</h3>
    <p>
      Note on this exercise set: on SQLzoo's site, they use
      each time <code>JOIN</code> without the word <code>INNER</code>. We
      prefer the full name, so preferably always write <code>INNER JOIN</code>.
